remember     the brunette went over the plan once more and let the blonde out to do her stuff  \\n\\nbefore the blonde could shut the door  the brunette yelled out   be sure to be in and out in no more than 5 minutes   the blonde ran inside and the brunette waited in the car    and waited    and waited    and waited    and waited  after waiting for so long in the car  the blonde bursts out of the bank s doors  the alarm blaring loud enough to wake everyone up  the blonde was lugging a bank safe behind her by a rope tied around it  a security guard ran out of the bank  his pants down around his ankles and attempting to reach his gun  the blonde breathed heavily as she tried to put the safe in the car but finally just gave up and dropped the safe behind  she ran into the passenger seat and pulled the door shut  the car already moving  the security guard yelled   stop  stop   while the pair drove off  leaving the safe with rope tied tightly around it behind  the brunette frantically asked the blonde   what the hell happened in there     the blonde was panting and turned to the brunette and choked out   what do you mean  i followed the plan exactly   \\nthe brunette paused and

god tells a joke  the brunette laughs and goes to hell  then on the 2 000th step god tells a joke  the redhead laughs and goes to hell  on the 3 000th step god tells a joke  the blonde doesn t laugh and proceeds to the gate  suddenly  she bursts out laughing  god asks   what are you laughing about    so she replies   i just got the first joke    a blonde is walking down the street with her blouse open  exposing one of her breasts  a nearby policeman approaches her and remarks   ma am  are you aware that i could cite you for indecent exposure    why  officer   asks the blonde   because your blouse is open and your breast is exposed    oh my goodness   exclaims the blonde   i must have left my baby on the bus   a blonde  brunette and a redhead run to the top of a burning building  below  a few firefighters are holding a blanket telling the redhead to jump when the redhead jumps the firefighters snatch the blanket away and she hits the concrete when the firefighters ask the brunette to jump she jumps and again they pull the blanket away when the firefighters ask the blonde to jump she replies   i don t trust you  so just put the blanket down and back away   an exhausted looking blond dragged herself in to the doctor s office   doctor  there are dogs all over my neighborhood  they bark all day and all night  and i can t get a wink of sleep   i have good news for you   the doctor answered  rummaging through a drawer full of sample medications   here are some new sleeping pills that work like a dream  a few of these and your trouble will be over   great   the blond answered   i ll try anything  let s give it a shot  a few weeks later the blond returned  looking worse than ever   doc  your plan is no good  i m more tired than before   i don t understand how that could be   said the doctor  shaking his head   those are the strongest pills on the market   that may be true   answered the blond wearily   but i m still up all night chasing those dogs and when i finally catch one it s hard getting him to swallow the pill   three blondes were all applying for the last available position on the highway patrol  the detective conducting the interview looked at the 3 of them and said   so ya ll want to be a cop  eh  the blondes all nodded  the detective got up  opened a file drawer and pulled out a file folder  sitting back down  he opened it up and withdrew a picture  and said   to be a detective  you have to be able to detect  you must be able to notice things such as distinguishing features and oddities such as scars  etc  so he stuck the photo in the face of the 1st blonde and withdrew it after about 2 seconds   now  he said   did you notice any distinguishing features about the man  the blonde immediately said   yes  i did  he has only one eye  the detective shook his head and said   of course he has only one eye in this picture  it s a profile of his face  you re dismissed  the 1st blonde hung her head and walked out of the office  the detective then turned to the 2nd blonde  stuck the photo in her face for 2 seconds  pulled it back and said   what about you  notice anything unusual or outstanding about this man   yes  he only has one ear  the detective put his head in his hand and exclaimed   didn t you hear what i just told the other lady  this is a profile of the man s face  of course you can only see one ear   you re excused  too  the 2nd blonde sheepishly walked out of the office  the detective turned his attention to the 3rd and last blonde and said   this is probably a waste of time  but         he flashed the photo in her face for a couple of seconds and withdrew it  saying  all right  did you notice anything distinguishing or unusual about this man  the blonde said   i did  this man wears contact lenses  the detective frowned  took another look at the picture and began looking at some of the papers in the folder  he looked up at the blonde with a puzzled expression and said   you re absolutely right  his bio says he wears contacts    how in the world could you tell that by looking at this picture  the blonde rolled her eyes and said   well duh  with only one eye and one ear  he certainly can t wear glasses   two friends  a blonde and a redhead  are walking down the street and pass a flower shop where the redhead saw her boyfriend buying flowers \\n\\nredhead sighed and said   oh  crap  my boyfriend is buying me flowers again  \\n\\nthe blonde looked quizzically at her and said   you don t like getting flowers from your boyfriend  \\n\\nthe redhead said   i love getting flowers  but he always has expectations after giving me flowers  and i just don t feel like spending the next three days on my back with my legs in the air  \\n\\nthe blonde says   don t you have a vase   a lawyer and a blonde are sitting next to each other on a long flight from la to ny the lawyer leans over to her and asks if she would like to play a fun game  the blonde just wants to take a nap  so she politely declines and rolls over to the window to catch a few winks  the lawyer persists and explains that the game is really easy and a lot of fun  he explains  i ask you a question  and if you don t know the answer  you pay me  5  and vice versa   again  she politely declines and tries to get some sleep  the lawyer  now somewhat agitated  says   okay  if you don t know the answer you pay me  5  and if i don t know the answer that you ll ask me  i will pay you  500    figuring that since she is a blonde that he will easily win the match  this catches the blonde s attention and  figuring that there will be no end to this torment unless she plays  agrees to the game  the lawyer asks the first question   what s the distance from the earth to the moon   the blonde doesn t say a word  reaches in to her purse  pulls out a five dollar bill and hands it to the lawyer  now  it s the blonde s turn  she asks the lawyer   what goes up a hill with three legs  and comes down with four   the lawyer looks at her with a puzzled look  he takes out his laptop computer and searches all his references he taps into the airphone with his modem and searches the net and the library of congress  frustrated  he sends e mails to all his coworkers and friends he knows  all to no avail  afterover an hour  he wakes the blonde and hands her  500  the blonde politely takes the  500 and turns away to get back to sleep  the lawyer  who is more than a little miffed  wakes the blonde and asks   well  so what is the answer    without a word  the blonde reaches into her purse  hands the lawyer  5  and goes back to sleep  two bowling teams  one all blondes  one all bruneettes  charter a double decker bus for a weekend bowling tournament in atlantic city  \\nthe brunette team rides on the bottom level of the bus  the blonde team rides on the top level  \\nthe brunette team  down below  is wooping it up and having a great time until one of them realizes she doesn t hear anything from the blondes upstairs  and she decides to investigate  \\nwhen the brunette reaches the top  she finds the blonde team staring straight ahead at the road  frozen in fear  clutching the seats in frount of them with white knuckles  \\n whats goimg on up here   asks the brunette   we re having a great time downstairs   \\n yeah   screams a terrified blonde   but you ve got a driver   a blonde is terribly overweight  so her doctor puts her on a diet   i want you to eat regularly for 2 days  then skip a day  and repeat this procedure for 2 weeks  the next time i see you  you ll have lost at least 5 pounds   when the blonde returned  she shocked the doctor by losing nearly 20 pounds   why  that s amazing   the doctor said   did you follow my instructions   the blonde nodded   i ll tell you though  i thought i was going to drop dead that 3rd day    from hunger  you mean    asked the doctor    no  from all that skipping   a blonde motorist was two hours from sydney when she was flagged down by a man whose truck had broken down  the man walked up to the blonde s car and asked   are you going to sydney   sure   answered the blonde   do you need a lift   not for me  i ll be spending the next three hours fixing my truck  my problem is i ve got two chimpanzees in the back which have to be delivered to taronga park zoo  they re a bit stressed already so i don t want to keep them on the road all day  could you possibly take them to the zoo for me  i ll give you fifty dollars for your trouble   i d be happy to   said the blonde so the two chimpanzees were ushered into the back seat of the blonde s car and carefully strapped into their seat belts  off they went five hours later  the truck driver was driving through the heart of sydney when suddenly he was horrified  there was the blonde walking down the street and holding hands with the two chimps  much to the amusement of the crowd with a screech of brakes he pulled off the road and ran over to the blonde  what the hell are you doing here   he demanded   i gave you fifty dollars to take these chimpanzees to the zoo   yes  i know you did   said the blonde   but just as we arrived it looked like it was going to rain so we decided to see a movie instead   a brunette  a blonde  and a redhead all worked in the same office with the same female boss  every day  they noticed their boss left work early \\n\\none day  the girls decided that when the boss left  they d leave right behind her  after all  she never called in or came back to the office when she left early  so how was she to know \\n\\nthe next day  they all three left the office right after the boss left  the brunette was thrilled to be home early  she did a little gardening and went to bed early \\n\\nthe redhead was elated to be able to get in a quick workout at the health club before meeting her dinner date \\n\\nthe blonde was happy  happy  happy to be home  but when she got to the bedroom she heard a muffled noise from inside  slowly  quietly  she cracked open the door and was mortified to see her husband in bed with her boss \\n\\never so gently  she closed the door and crept out of her house  the next day at coffee break  the brunette and redhead decided they were leaving early again  and asked the blonde if she was coming with them \\n\\n no way   she exclaimed   i almost got caught yesterday  this fat guy sees an ad for a new gym guaranteeing to reduce anyone s weight by 5  10 or 20 kilograms on the first day  so he goes and tells them he wants to lose 5 kg  they strip him and lead him into a huge gym with all kinds of ropes and parallel bars and ladders and tell him to wait a minute  he s standing there when on the far side of the gym a door opens and out steps a gorgeous blonde  stark naked  with a sign saying  if you catch me  i m yours   he starts running  and just as he gets close  she starts picking up speed  before he knows it  he s running all over the gym  up the ladders  down the ladders  across the parallel bars  here and there  and just as he s about to catch the blonde  pop  she disappears through a door  in comes the management who lead him to the showers  and then weigh him  sure enough  he lost exactly 5 kg  he s back on the street and starts to think   jesus  i was so close to catching her  if i had a little more time     so he races back to the gym and says   i want to lose 20 more kg    no problem   says the manager  again he strips  and is led to the large gym  this time he s standing by the door when it opens  out comes a gorilla with a sign  if i catch you  you re mine   one day three women went

the redhead decided to play a joke on her  they skinned a rabbit and snuck up on the blonde  put the guts behind her and ran back to the campsite  three minutes later they heard a scream  then they waited another half an hour and the blonde came back  sweating  she said   i had to poop so hard i pooped my guts out  but with the grace of god and these two fingers  i think i got them back in

three blondes were all vying for the last available position on the local police force  the detective conducting the interview looked at the three of them and said   so you all want to be a cop  eh  the blondes all nodded  the detective got up  opened a file drawer and pulled out a file folder  sitting back down  he opened it up and withdrew a photograph  and said   to be a detect  you have to be able to detect  you must be able to notice things such as distinguishing features and oddities such as scars  etc   so saying  he stuck the photo in the face of the first blonde and withdrew it after about 2 seconds   now  he said   did you notice any distinguishing features about this man  the blonde immediately said   yes  i did  he only has one eye  the detective shook his head and said   of course he only has one eye in this picture  it s a profile of his face  you re dismissed  the first blonde hung her head and walked out of the office  the detective then turned to the second blonde  stuck the photo in her face for two seconds  pulled it back and said   what about you  notice anything unusual or outstanding about this man  the blonde immediately shot back   yep  he only has one ear  the detective put his head in his hand and exclaimed   didn t you hear what i just said to the other lady  this is a profile of the man s face  of course you can only see one ear   you re excused  too  you d never make a good detective  the second blonde sheepishly walked out of the office the detective turn his attention to the last blonde and said   this is probably a waste of time  but       he flashed the photo in her face for a couple of seconds and withdrew it  saying   alright  did you notice anything distinguishing or unusual about this man  the blonde said   yes  i did  this man wears contact lenses  the detective frowned  took another look at the picture and began looking at some of the papers in the folder  he looked up at the blonde with a puzzled expression and said   you re absolutely right  his bio says he wears contacts  how in the world could tell that by looking at this picture  the blonde rolled her eyes and said   duh  he has only one eye and one ear  he certainly can t wear glasses   i know a blond so stupid i asked her to take me to the airport she looked up at the billboard it said  airport left  she turned around and went home q how can you tell if a blonde is having a bad day  a her tampon is on her ear and she cant find her pen  one day two blondes each bought a pig   the problem they were having was telling the two pigs apart   so  the first blonde had an idea  she said   i ll cut my pig s tail off  then we will know the difference   so she cut her pig s tail off   that night the pigs got in a fight and one pig bit the other pig s tail off   the next morning the blonde had a solution  she said  i ll just cut my pig s right back leg off   so  she did   that night same thing  the pigs got in a fight and one pig bit the other pig s right back leg off   the next morning the blondes were real upset and finally decided to cut the back left leg from the pig  so she did   that night the pigs got in a fight and one pig bit the other pig s back left leg off   the next morning the blondes were really upset and didn t know how they were going to tell their pigs apart   so  one of them stated   i will cut my pig s right front leg off  then we can tell our pigs apart   so  she did   that night the pigs got in a fight and one pig bit the other pig s right front leg off   the blondes were really upset and decided the only logical explanation would be to cut the remaining leg off one pig  so  they did   that night the pigs got in a fight and one pig bit the other pig s only leg off   the next morning when the blondes awoke they were devastated   finally  the other blonde spoke up and said    how about you take the white one and i ll take the black one   one day  a blonde s neighbor goes over to her house  sees the blonde crying  and asks her what happened  the blonde said that her mother had passed away  the neighbor made her some coffee and calmed her down a little and then left  the next day the neighbor went back

office  she tells the dr     it hurts all over my body   he says   point to where it hurts   she points to her shoulder and yells  ouch    she then points to her hip and yells  ouch    finally she

and down the driveway he goes as he is coming out of his garage rain is pouring down  it is like a torrential downpour  there is snow mixed in with the rain  and the wind is blowing 50 mph  minutes later  he returns to the garage he comes back into the house and turns the tv to the weather channel  he finds it s going to be bad weather all day long  so he puts his boat back in the garage  quietly undresses and slips back into bed there he cuddles up to his wife s back  now with a different anticipation  and whispers  the weather out there is terrible  to which she sleepily replies

being afraid of spending the rest of her life alone  she decided to marry  she had been with so many perverted men over the years that she felt she needed a change and would only get one by marrying a virgin male near her age  she took out ads in newspapers around the world seeking a male virgin who was 55 years old  she finally narrowed her choice to an australian computer programmer  after a thorough background check  she was satisfied that he had indeed never been with a woman and they were married  on their wedding night  she went into the bathroom to change into her nightie  when she came back out  she found that her new husband had taken the bed and everything in the room and stacked it in one corner of the room thinking this was rather kinky  she said to her husband   thought you had never been with a woman  he replied   that s true  but if it s anything like screwing a kangaroo  we re going to need all the room we can get   a man comes home from work  sits in his lazyboy in front of the tv and rudely tells his wife   gimme a beer before it starts   she gives him his beer  about 15 minutes later  he says again   gimme a beer before it starts   she does  a few minutes later  he asks again for a beer  the wife says   don t you think you re drinking too much beer  it hasn t been half an hour that you got here and you ve already had two beers  i m getting fed up with

should have separate suites  she is concerned that the old fellow could overexert himself  after the festivities  she prepares herself for bed and for the knock on the door she is expecting  sure enough the knock comes and there is her groom ready for action  they unite in conjugal union and all goes well  whereup on he takes his leave of her and she prepares to go to sleep for the night  after a few minutes there s a knock on the door and there the old guy is again  ready for more action  somewhat surprised she consents to further coupling  which is again successful  after which the octogenarian bids her a fond good night and leaves  she is certainly ready for slumber at this point and is close to sleep for the second time  when there is another knock at the door and there he is again fresh as a 20 year old and ready for more  once again  they do the horizontal boogie  as they re laying in afterglow the young bride says to him   i am really impressed that a guy your age has enough juice to go for it three times  i ve been with guys less than half your age who were only good for one   the old guy looks puzzled and turns to her and says   was i already here   a man was walking down the street when he noticed his grandfather sitting on the porch  in the rocking chair  with nothing on from the waist down   grandpa  what are you doing   he exclaimed  the old man looked off in the distance without answering   grandpa  what are you doing sitting out here with nothing on below the waist   he asked again  the old man slowly looked at him and said  well  last week i sat

bill for  350  the man explodes and demands to know why the charge is so high  he tells the clerk although it s a nice hotel  the rooms certainly aren t worth  350  when the clerk explains that  350

once a year   all you have to do is say  123  and it shall rise for as long as you wish     the guy then asks the witch doctor  what happens when it s over     the witch doctor says  all you have to say is  1234  and it will go down   but be warned it will not work again for a year   the guy goes home and that night he is ready to surprise his wife with the good news         so  he is lying in

a mall  they were amazed by almost everything they saw  but especially by two shiny  silver walls that could move apart and back together again  the boy asked his father   what is this  father   the father  never having seen an elevator  responded  son  i have never seen anything like this in my life  i don t know what it is  while the boy and his father were watching wide eyed  an old lady in a wheel chair rolled up to the moving walls and pressed a button  the walls opened and the lady rolled between them into a small room  the walls closed and the boy and his father watched small circles of lights with numbers above the walls light up  they continued to watch the circles light up in the reverse direction the walls opened up again and a beautiful 24 year old woman stepped out  the father said to his son   go get your mother   a man and a woman are riding next to each other in first class  the man sneezes and then starts screaming with extasy and pleasure  a few minutes pass

fully aroused  the woman has finally had enough  she turns to the man and says   three times you ve sneezed  and three times you ve acted as if youv e had great sex  what the hell kind of degenerate

wondering if you could possibly pass me another blanket   the man leans out and  with a glint in his eye  says   i ve got a better idea    let s pretend we re married    why not   giggles the woman

throat for some time and felt that this was their last straw  when they arrived at the counselor s office  the counselor jumped right in and opened the floor for discussion  what seems to be the problem  immediately  the husband held his long face down without anything to say  on the other hand  the wife began talking 90 miles an hour describing all the wrongs within their marriage after 5     10     15 minutes of listening to the wife  the counselor went over to her  picked her up by her shoulders  kissed her passionately for several minutes  and sat her back down afterwards  the wife sat there speechless he looked over at the husband who was staring in disbelief at what had happened the counselor spoke to the husband   your wife needs that at least twice a week  the husband scratched his head and replied   i can have her here on tuesdays and thursdays   a married couple was in a terrible accident where the woman s face was severely burned  the doctor told the husband that they couldn t graft any skin from her body because she was too skinny  so the husband offered to donate some of his own skin  however  the only skin on his body that the doctor felt was suitable would have to come from his buttocks  the husband and wife agreed that they would tell no one about where the skin came from  and requested that the doctor also honor their secret  after all  this was a very delicate matter after the surgery was completed  everyone was astounded at the woman s new beauty  she looked more beautiful than she ever had before all her friends and relatives just went on and on about her youthful beauty  one day  she was alone with her husband  and she was overcome with emotion at his sacrifice  she said   dear  i just want to thank you for everything you did for me  there is no way i could ever repay you   my darling   he replied   think nothing of it  i get all the thanks i need every time i see your mother kiss you on the cheek   a man takes his wife to the live

veterinarian determined the problem  the gorilla was in heat  to make matters worse  there were no male gorilla species available  while reflecting on their problem  the zoo administrators noticed mike  an employee responsible for cleaning the animals  cages  mike  it was rumored  possessed ample ability to satisfy any female  but he wasn t very bright  so  the zoo administrators thought they might have a solution  mike was approached with a proposition  would he be willing to have sex with the gorilla for five hundred bucks  mike showed some interest  but said he would have to think the matter over carefully  the following day  mike announced that he would accept their offer  but only under three conditions   first   he said   i don t want to have to kiss her  secondly  i want nothing to do with any offspring that may result from this union   the zoo administration quickly agreed to these conditions  so they asked what was his third condition   well   said mike   you ve gotta give me another week to come up with the five hundred bucks   man s business trip is cancelled and he is at home with a rather nervous wife  they go to bed  but about midnight  the phone rings

doctor  the man complains that when they have sex  the first time is ok but during the second time he sweats like a pig  the doctor asks the wife if she has any idea why her husbands sweats like that

did you buy her last year   the other one asked  last year i bought her a very expensive cemetery plot    hmmmm  hard to top that one   said the other the two guys couldn t come up with anything  so the son in law didn t buy his mother in law anything for her birthday  when the big day arrived the next weekend  she was a bit upset  at the family gathering for her birthday  she announced out loud to everyone   thank you all for the wonderful gifts  too bad my daughter and son in law weren t so thoughtful  thinking quickly  the son in law responded   well  you haven t used the gift i gave you last year   in days of old  when knights were bold  this particular knight was leaving for a crusade and called one of his squires   i m leaving for the crusade  here is the key to my wife s chastity belt  if  in 10 years  i haven t returned  you may use the key as i m sure she will have needs   the knight sets out on the dusty road  armored from head to toe  he takes one last look at his castle and sees the squire rushing across the drawbridge  yelling   stop  stop  thank goodness i was able to catch you  this is the wrong key   three couples went in to see the minister to see how to become members of his church  the minister said that they would have to go without sex for two weeks and then come back and tell him how it went  the first couple was retired  the second couple was middle aged and the final couple was newlywed  two weeks went by  and the couples returned to the minister  the retired couple said it was no problem at all  the middle aged couple said it was tough for the first week  but after that  it was no problem  the newlyweds said it was fine until she dropped the can of paint    can of paint    exclaimed the minister    yeah    said the newlywed man    she dropped the can and when she bent over to pick it up i had to have her right there and then  lust took over    the minister just shook his head and said that they were not welcome in the church   that

the husband   and don t you ever forget it  i m the man who wears the pants in this family  with that  she flipped him her panties and said   try these on   he tried them on  and found he could only

nights out and coming home in a drunken state  but  harry still continued his nightly routine  one day  the distraught wife was talking to a friend about her husband s behavior  the friend listened and suggested   why don t you treat him a little differently when he comes home  instead of berating him  why don t you give him some loving words and welcome him home with a kiss  then  he might change his ways   the wife thought that this might be a good idea  that night  harry took off again after dinner  and  at about midnight  he arrived home in his usual condition  his wife heard him at the door  she quickly opened it and let harry in  instead of berating him as she had always done  this time she took his arm and led him into the living room  she sat harry down in an easy chair  put his feet up on the foot stool  and took his shoes off  then  she went behind him and started to cuddle him a little  after a short while  she whispered to harry   it s pretty late  dear  i think we should go upstairs to bed now  don t you think   harry replied in his inebriated state   heck  i guess we might as well  i ll get in trouble when i get home anyway   an old man goes to the doctor for

beautiful kitchen and master bath suite and jacuzzi  as they  oohed and aahed  the old man asked peter how much all this was going to cost  it s free   peter replied   this is heaven  next they went

tables   the old man asked timidly peter lectured   that s the best part       you can eat as much as you like of whatever you like and you never get fat and you never get sick  this is heaven  with

at his wife and said   this is all your fault  if it weren t for your bran muffins  i could have been here ten years ago   a concerned husband went to a doctor to talk about his wife  he says to the doctor   doctor  i think my wife is deaf because she never hears me the first time and always asks me to repeat things    well   the doctor replied   go home and tonight stand about 15 feet from her and say something to her  if she doesn t reply move about 5 feet close and say itagain  keep doing this so that we ll get an idea about the severity of her deafness   sure enough  the husband goes home and does exactly as instructed  he starts off about 15 feet from his wife in the kitchen as she is chopping some vegetables and says   honey  what s for dinner   he hears no response  he moves about 5 feet closer and asks again  no reply  he moves 5 feet closer  still no reply  he gets fed up and moves right behind her  about an inch away  and asks again   honey  what s for dinner   she replies   for the fourth time  vegetable stew   doc  you ve gotta help me    my wife just isn t interested in sex anymore  haven t you got a pill or something i can give her   look  i can t prescribe

is finished  she goes to the kitchen to bring dessert  our hero  in fumbling haste  pulls the pills from his pocket and drops one into his wife s coffee  he reflects for a moment  hesitates  then drops in a second pill  and then he begins to worry  the doctor did say they were powerful  then an inspiration strikes  he drops one pill into his own coffee his wife returns with the shortcake  and they enjoy their dessert and coffee  our hero with poorly concealed anticipation  sure enough  a few minutes after they finish  his wife shudders a little  sighs deeply and heavily  and a strange smoky look enters her eyes  in a deep  throaty  near whisper  in a tone of voice he has never heard her use before  she says   i    need   a man    his eyes glitter and his hands tremble as he replies   me    too    it was a hot summer day  and the old courthouse was just as hot  the air was thick and humid  and the jury was having a hard time staying focused  one of the jurors succumbed to the heat  falling asleep just as the victim was being questioned by the prosecutor   the defendant is accused of making obscene phone calls to your home  would you please tell the jury precisely what the defendant said when he called you   asked the prosecutor   i can t do that   the victim replied   it was so crude and disgusting  i can t use language like that    would it help to just write it down   the victim wrote out every detail of what the obscene caller had said  and passed the note to the judge  the judge read the note  it was then passed to the prosecutor  the defense attorney  and finally to the jury  the sleeping juror was seated at the back corner of the jury box  and was the last to receive the note  he was awoken with a nudge from an attractive young juror  seated next to him  and she passed him the note  he read it  gazed in awe at the woman  and read it again  he turned to her  smiling broadly  and winked  he then put the note into his pocket  the judge demanded   please pass that note to the bailiff    but your honor   the juror protested   it s a private matter   mr  benton thought he had had the last word when he presented his ex wife with an unusual gift

she s also managed to wash up on shore from the sinking ship  he makes his way to her  and with some mouth to mouth assistance he manages to get her breathing again  she looks up at him  wide eyed and

eating anyway  it was really\\ndelicious and he said so  despite the dirty dishes \\n\\nwhen dinner was over  the hostess took the dishes outside  put them on the ground  and\\nyelled   here soap  here water  come here boys    a 60 year old woman came home one day and heard strange noises in her bedroom  she opened the door and discovered her 40 year old daughter playing with her vibrator   what are you doing   asked the mom   mom  i am 40 years old and look at me  i am ugly  i will never get married so this is pretty much my husband   the mother walked out of the room  shaking her head  the next day the father came home and heard noises in the bedroom and upon entering the room found his daughter using the vibrator   what the hell are you doing   he asked  his daughter replied   i already told mom  i am 40 years old now and ugly  i will never get married so this is as close as i ll ever get to a husband   the father walked out of the room shaking his head too  the next day the

the bed  you must promise never to look in it   in all their 25 years of marriage jane never looked  however  on the afternoon of their 25th anniversary curiosity got the best of her and she lifted the lid and peeked inside  in the box were 3 empty beer cans and  1371 75 in cash  she closed the box and put it back under the bed  now that she knew what was in the box  she was doubly curious as to why  that evening they were out for a special dinner  after dinner jane could no longer contain her curiosity and she confessed  saying   i am so sorry  for all these years i kept my promise and never looked into the box under our bed  however today the temptation was too much and i gave in  but now i need to know why do you keep the empty cans in the box   bob thought for a while and said   i guess after all these years you deserve to know the truth  whenever i was unfaithful to you i put an empty beer can in the box under the bed to remind myself not to do it again   jane was shocked  but said   i am very disappointed and saddened but i guess after all those years away from home on the road  temptation does happen and i guess that 3 times is not that bad considering the years   they hugged and made their peace  a little while later jane asked bob   why do you have all that money in the box   bob answered   whenever the box filled with empties  i cashed them in   three guys were

does it every day  you can usually recognize him by his masculine body and the constant smile on his face  do we have anyone like this in the audience  a man got up from the audience and he fitted the description  big firm body with a smile on his face  then there is the second kind  they have sex once a week  they also have a generally happy mood  and look pretty good  but of course not as good as the first kind  is there any one of them here tonight   a second man got up  and he too fitted the description   the third kind do it once a month  they are chubby and usually grumpy  anyone of them here   the man that raised from his chair looked exactly like the expert claimed   and then there is the 4th kind  they do it once a year  they usually have a big belly  but the thing that is most tipical is that they are in a constant state of depression  i know it would be hard for him to admit  but if there is one of those in the audience  please rise  a fat and short man stood up  but in contrary to the experts prediction  he looked very cheerful   you do it only once a year    the expert asked  yes  only once a year   so why are you so happy    demanded the expert   well   said the man  cheeringly   tonight is the night      two women where at a pub  having a fun night out  away from their husbands  when they got out and started walking back home  they suddenly had a strong urge

succeeds only in forcing the thing in awfully deep  \\n\\nafter a few hours of fruitless rooting the couple decide to go to the hospital  but on their way out of the front door they meet their daughter coming in with her boyfriend  \\n\\nthe boyfriend takes control of the situation  he tells them he s studying medicine and that they re not to worry about a thing  he then sticks two fingers up the man s nose and asks him to blow  and low and behold  the nut shoots from the ear and out across the room \\n\\nas the daughter and her boyfriend go through to the kitchen to get drinks  the man and his wife sit down to discuss their luck   so  the wife says   what do you think he ll become after he finishes school  a gp or a surgeon   \\n\\n well says the man  rubbing his nose   by the smell

expensive   the man says   \\n\\n okay   says the dentist   if i save on anesthesia and simply rip the teeth out with a pair of pliers  i could get away with charging  20    \\n\\n nope   moans the man   it s still too much    \\n\\n hmm   says the dentist  scratching his head   if i let one of my students do it for the experience  i suppose i could charge you just  10    \\n\\n marvelous   says

his hunting skills  the man was undoubtedly a good shot and no one could dispute that  but then he said that they could blindfold him and he would recognize any animal s skin from its feel  and if he could locate the bullet hole he would even tell them what calibre the bullet was that killed the animal  the hunter said that he was willing to prove it if they would put up the drinks  and so the bet was on  they blindfolded him carefully and took him to his first animal skin  after feeling it for a few moments  he announced  bear   then he felt the bullet hole and declared   shot with a  308 rifle   he was right they brought him another skin  one that someone had in their car trunk  he took a bit longer this time and then said   elk  shot with a 7mm mag rifle  he was right again  through

try it   just give it a taste  if you don t like it  you don t have to finish it   they said reassuringly  finally  he agreed to give it a try  he dug his spoon in  picked up a small piece of matzo ball with some soup in the spoon  and gingerly tasted it  the usual  mmmm  sound could be heard coming from somewhere deep in his chest  and he quickly finished the soup   i must say  that was quite delicious   he said   but i was wondering… are there other parts of the matzo you can eat   karl was telling his buddies back on the farm about his first visit to a big city church   when i got there

person drinking jack daniels during the cantinascene if you hear        luke  i am your father       and your uncle   one day in the great state of alabama a man walks outside and hears this strange noise coming from one of his trees  he proceeds to walk over to his tree and looks up in the tree to find the source of this noise  what he finds is a large gorilla moving around in the top of his tree trying to get comfortable  the man stops and thinks to himself   how on earth am i going to get this gorilla out of my tree  there aren t any gorilla catchers in alabama are there  the man walks inside his house and gets his phone book and is looking in the animal control section and low and behold there actually is a gorilla catcher listed  so the man picks up the phone and calls the number  he reaches the gorilla catcher who says that he ll be there in ten minutes  the gorilla catcher shows up in a big truck with a tool box in the back and a very large dog sitting on top of the tool box and a very large cage sitting in back of the tool box   the gorilla catcher gets out of his truck and walks up to the man and shakes hands with him  the man then shows the gorilla catcher the tree and points up at the gorilla  after looking at the gorilla for a minute  the gorilla catcher walks back over to his truck and gets old clyde off the tool box and gets out a gun and walks back over to the tree and sits the gun down next to old clyde  the gorilla catcher looks over at the man and says   here s the plan  i m gonna climb this here tree and knock the gorilla out  when the gorilla hits the ground old clyde here s gonna bite him in the nuts and hold on  til i can get out of the tree and put the gorilla in the cage  any questions  the man can t think of any so the gorilla catcher starts making his way up the tree  when the catcher gets almost halfway up the tree the man notices the shotgun next to old clyde  he quickly calls up to the gorilla catcher and says   hey  what s the gun for  the gorilla catcher replies   oh  that s in case the gorilla knocks me out of the tree  i want u to shoot old clyde before i hit the ground   dear son  \\nim writing this slow cause i know you

explains that she s not fishing  to which he replied   but you have all this equipment  i will have to take you in and write you up   angry that the warden was being so unreasonable  the lady told the

labor  she was having a really tough time dealing with the pain  the doctor came to her husband and her and told them of a new experimental drug that allows the woman to transfer 25  of the pain to the father  the husband feels really bad for his wife so he decides they will try it the wife takes the pill and a few minutes later the husband says   i don t feel a thing  you women are babies  take another pill i can handle this   so the wife takes another pill  same thing happens  her husband tells her to take another pill  same thing  by now she has transferred 75  of her pain to her husband  she is feeling a little pain but her husband is still feeling nothing  he is convinced that women are complete wuses  he tells her   take another pill  this isn t hurting me at all  let me take all the pain away   so she does  now they are both feeling great a few hours later  the wife gives birth to a beautiful baby boy  the next day they take their newborn son home  and there they find the

sitting on the side of the highway waiting to catch speeding drivers  a state police officer sees a car puttering along at 22 mph  he thinks to himself   this driver is just as dangerous as a speeder   so he turns on his lights and pulls the driver over approaching the car  he notices that there are five old ladies    two in the front seat and three in the back   eyes wide and white as ghosts the driver  obviously confused  says to him   officer  i don t understand  i was doing exactly the speed limit  what seems to be the problem   ma am   the officer replies   you weren t speeding  but you should know that driving slower than the speed limit can also be a danger to other drivers   slower than the speed limit   she asked  no sir  i was doing the speed limit exactly    twenty two miles an hour   the old woman says a bit proudly  the state police officer  trying to contain a chuckle explains to her that  22  was the route number  not the speed limit  a bit embarrassed  the woman grinned and thanked the officer for pointing out her error  but before i let you go  ma am  i have to ask    is everyone in this car ok  these women seem awfully shaken and they haven t muttered a single peep this whole time   the officer asks  oh  they ll be alright in a minute officer  we just got off route 119   this guy had a very attractive wife  who was always wanting clothes  jewelry  etc   but he

woman had nothing to wipe with so she thought she d take off her\\n panties  use them  then throw them away   \\n\\nher friend  however  was wearing a rather expensive underwear set and didn t want to ruin hers but was \\nlucky to salvage a large ribbon from a wreath that was on one of the graves and proceeded to wipe herself with that   \\n\\nafter finishing  they then made off for home   \\n\\nthe next day the first woman s husband phoned the other husband and said   these girls night out have got to stop   my wife came home last night without her panties    \\n\\n that s nothing

becky  you did that for me  i respect you even more than ever  to do such a thing for me     so when was number 2    well  sam  remember when you had that last heart attack and you were needing that

her morning coffee when she noticed a most unusual funeral procession approaching the nearby cemetery  a long black hearse was followed by a second black hearse just 50 feet behind  behind the second hearse was a solitary woman walking a pit bull on a leash  behind her 200 women walking single file  the woman s curiosity got the best of her  she respectfully approached the woman walking the dog and said   i am so sorry for your loss and i know now is a bad time to disturb you  but i ve never seen a funeral like this  whose funeral is it   the woman replied   well  the first hearse is for my husband    what happened to him   the woman replied   my dog attacked and killed him   the woman was even more inquisitive   well  who s in the second hearse    my mother in law  she tried to help my husband when the dog turned on her and killed her too   a poignant and thoughtful moment of silence passed between the two women   could i borrow that dog    get in line   a policeman sent his wife and child to a sea resort for a vacation  after a week he joins them in the hotel  since he s been away from his wife for a week  he wants to make love with her \\n\\n no darling  we can t do it here

your clothes on immediately  shame on you  you can t do that in public  \\n\\n you re right   said the husband   but it was a moment of weakness  we didn t see each other for a week  by the way  i m a policeman too and it would be very embarrassing if you were to fine me  \\n\\n don t worry  you re a colleague and it s your first time  but this is the third time i caught her making love on this beach in the last week and she ll have to pay for it   there was a man and his wife walking down the road on their way home the wife saw a baby skunk laying in the grass  so she decided to take it home and take care of it  on the way home they came up to a river  the wife  concered for the skunk  asked her husband what to do with the skunk so he doesn t get wet  the husband replied   well

ask  um   what  st  peter says  if you step on one duck  it quacks  if a duck quacks  other ducks will start quacking  and   well   you ll see  with that  the gates opened and the three waltzed inside  and  sure enough  all of heaven is covered with ducks  there is almost no room to walk with the millions of ducks a day of careful stepping later  the first woman steps on a duck  seconds later  every single duck in heaven is quacking  it s so loud the women aren t suprised if earth could hear it  hours later  when the  quacking ceased  an angel appears with a ver ugly man and chains him to the lady and tells her this is her eternal punishment for the duck stepping  not wanting the same fate  the other two women become very cautious for the next week  but sure enough  the second lady steps on a duck she gets the same punishment as the first lady the third lady becomes so careful that  a year and a half later  she is still duck free  then  an angel appears next to her with a very handsome man and chains him to her  thinking that this must be a reward for her good doing she asks the man gleefully  what did i do to deserve this  and the man replies with a grimace   i don t know about you  but i stepped on a duck   joan  who was a rather well proportioned secretary  spent almost all of her vacation sunbathing on the roof of her hotel  she wore a bathing suit the first day  but on the second  she decided that no one could see her way  up there  and she slipped out of it for an overall tan  she d hardly begun  when she heard someone running up the stairs  she was lying on her stomach  so she just pulled a towel over her rear   excuse me  miss   said the flustered assistant manager of the hotel  out  of breath from running up the stairs   the hilton doesn t mind your sunbathing on the roof  but we would very much appreciate your wearing a  bathing suit as you did yesterday    what difference does it make   joan asked rather calmly   no one can see  me up here  and

  the attendant looks down at the shoe covering her crotch and replies   i m sorry miss  he s too far in   if you had bought  1000 worth of nortel stock one year ago  it would now be worth  49

the cupboard was a wilted lettuce leaf  an egg  and a can of cat food  in a panic  she opened the can of cat food  stirred in the egg  and garnished it with the lettuce leaf just as her husband pulled up she greeted her husband and then watched in horror as he sat down to his dinner  to her surprise  the husband really enjoyed his dinner   darling  this is the best dinner you have made for me in forty years of marriage  you can make this for me any old day  needless to say  every bridge night from then on  the woman made her husband the same dish  she told her bridge cronies about it and they were all horrified  you re going to kill him   they exclaimed two months later  her husband died the women were sitting around the table playing bridge when one of the cronies said   you killed him

said the first woman but the other woman said   oh sire  do not spill innocent blood  let the other woman s daughter marry him  the wise king did not hesitate a moment   the attorney must marry the first lady s daughter   he proclaimed  but she was willing to hew him in two   exclaimed the king s court  indeed   said wise king solomon   that shows she is the true mother in law   a married couple

a rib   there was a middle aged couple who had two stunningly beautiful blonde teen aged daughters  they decided to try one last time for the son they always wanted  after months of trying  the wife became pregnant and sure enough  nine months later delivered a healthy baby boy the joyful father rushed to the nursery to see his new son  he took one look and was horrified to see the ugliest child he has ever seen  he went to his wife and said that there was no way that he could be the father of that child   look at the two beautiful daughters i fathered   then he gave her a stern look and asked   have you been fooling around on me  the wife just smiled sweetly and said   not this time   a middle aged woman has a heart attack  while on the operating table she has a near death experience  she sees god  and asks if this is it  god says no  that she has another 30 40 years to live  she recovers  and decides to stay in the hospital and have a face lift  liposuction  tummy tuck  hair dyed  etc  she figures since she s got another 30 or 40 years she might as well make the most of it  she walks out of the hospital after the last operation and immediately gets hit by an ambulance  she arrives in front of god and asks   i thought you said i had another 30 or 40 years   to which god replies   to tell you the truth  i didn t recognize you   a man comes home from work and finds his wife admiring her breasts in the mirror  he asks   what are you doing  she replies   i went to the doctor today  and he told me i have the breasts of a 25 year old  the husband retorts   well  what did he say about your 50 year old ass  she replied   frankly dear  your name never came up   a blonde suspected that her boyfriend was cheating on her  so she bought a gun  she went to his apartment that same day  with the pistol in hand  sure enough  when she opened the door  she found her boyfriend in the arms of a redhead  overcome with grief  she put the gun to the side of her head  her boyfriend screamed  “honey  don’t do it   ” the blonde yelled back  “shut up  you’re next ” a husband and wife were having an argument  suddenly the husband picked up a bottle lying near him and threw it at his wife  the bottle missed the wife and got into the neighbours  house breaking the window glass \\nnow both the husband and wife got embarassed and went to apologise to the neighbour  upon reaching the house  they found out a young man sitting on a couch with a smile on his face  before the couple could say anything  the man said   i am a genie  i was enclosed in that bottle for many years  but you two have set me free  so ask for any three boons you want to and it shall be fulfilled  but against your three boons you will have to fulfill one wish of mine   the couple were so happy that they didn t think twice and presented their wishes  i want millions of dollars in my account   the husband said   done   said the genie  i want diamond jewelleries in all my vaults    done   said the genie  i want bunglows all over the world   said the husband  done   said the geniee now it was the time of the genies wish   so  the genie said   i have fulfilled all the three wishes you have said  and its time for my wish  i have not slept with a women for long  i wish to have sex with your wife  the couple got worried  but the husband explained that it was only a genie and it didn t matter much to him  besides the genie has given them a lot of things  so the wife consented  the geniee and the wife had a lovely night together  finally in the morning the genie said   it was wonderful but how old is your husband   why  he is just thirty five  my god    said the geniee   even at thirty five he still believes in geniees   a man escapes from a prison where he had been kept  for 15 years  as he runs away  he finds a house and  breaks into it  looking for money and guns  but only  finds a young couple in bed  he orders the guy out of bed and ties him up in a chair  while tying the girl up to the bed  he gets on top of her  kisses  her on the neck  then gets up  and goes to the bathroom   while he s in there  the husband tells his wife   listen  this guy is an escaped prisoner  look at  his clothes  he probably spent lots of time in jail  and hasn t seen a woman in years  i saw how he kissed your neck  if he wants sex  don t resist   don t complain  just do what he

beach contemplating how badly she got in her divorce settlement  when she spies a magic lamp washing up on the shore  ten fold she rubs the lamp and out pops a magical genie  the genie notices her anger and lets her vent her troubles to him  as a consolation the genie informs her that he will give her three wishes  but  he cautions her that because he does not believe in divorce  he will give her ex husband ten times the amount of whatever she wishes  the woman is steaming mad  thinking that this is hardly fair  but she makes her first wish  the first wish was for a billion dollars  the genie grants her wish and she finds herself sitting on a pile on one billion one dollar bills  the genie then reminds her that her husband is now the recipient of 10 billion dollars  the woman can barely contain her anger when she makes her second wish  the second wish was for a beautiful mansion on the shore of her own private bach  in an instant it was granted  but then genie then reminds her again that her ex husband now owns ten of what she wished for  and points out at the beach to a small development of ten such mansions  upon hearing this  the woman takes her time to contemplate her last wish  just as the genie was about to give up on her  the women informs the genie that she wants to make her last wish  but  before she can do this  the genie warns her that her ex husband will get ten times what she wishes for  “no problem ” said the woman as she grinned in ecstasy  “for my last wish  i’d like to give birth to twins ” a woman is in bed with her lover  who also happens to be

wanted to purchase a gift for his new sweetheart s birthday  and as they had not been dating very long  after careful consideration he decided a pair of gloves would strike the right note   romantic  but not too personal \\n\\naccompanied by his sweetheart s younger sister  he went to nordstorm and bought a pair of white gloves  the sister purchased a pair of panties for herself  during the wrapping  the clerk mixed up the items and the sister got the gloves and the sweetheart got the panties  without checking the contents  the young man sealed the package and sent it to his sweetheart with the note  \\n\\n i chose these because i noticed that you are not in the habit of wearing any when we go out in the evening  if it had not been for your sister  i would have chosen the long ones with the buttons  but she wears short ones that are easier to remove these are a delicate shade  but the lady i bought them from showed me the pair she had been wearing for the past three weeks and they were hardly soiled  i had her try yours on for me and she looked really smart  i wish i was there to put them on for you the first time  as no doubt other hands will come in contact with them before i have a chance to see you again \\n\\nwhen you take them off  remember to blow in them before putting them away as they will naturally be a little damp from wearing  just think how many times i will kiss them during the coming year  i hope you will wear them for me on friday night  all my love \\n\\n ps the latest style is to wear them folded down with a little fur showing   whats the

first guy is pretty bewlidered  but he thinks  something he has not done in quite a while and says    uhhh    i wanna be 2 times smarter yup    so the genie grants his wish and he becomes two times smarter  and begins to recite the multiplication tables  the genie turns to the other guy  who was slightly smarter than the first one  and asks him what he wants  the man replies  well  i don t want to be stupider than he is  so let me be 10 times smarter  the genie grants his wish and he suddenly is able to recite any word out of the dictionary  and can practically do anything the genie turns to the last guy and asks him what his wish is  the guy thinks hard for a moment  and the perfect wish comes to him he says proudly   i want to be 100 times smarter than i am now  the genie looks at him uncertainly  and tries to persuade him to wish for something else  the man gets angry  and says  make me 100 times smarter       the genie sighs  and promptly turns him into a woman  a woman was very

pretty good cooks  why don t you handle the cooking   the frenchman agrees  and the american turns to the japanese man  that leaves you to organize the supplies  he says  the japanese man agrees and each man sets about his tasks   \\n\\n \\na year passes  and the sociologists return to see how the men have done   they expect to find three desperate men  unhappy with having to live on the  island  but instead find a huge wooden house with verandas and porches  and  balconies  the american comes to greet them  and when they  express their surprise about the house he just shrugs and says   yeah well i  had a lot of  raw materials so i kind of went to town and did the place up   the teams are  amazed and are shown inside to the kitchen where they re  greeted with the  most amazing smell of delicious food    \\n\\nthe frenchman sees their  surprise and  just shrugs  i had lots to work with  he says   this island has  loads of  edible herbs  and plants    \\n\\nthe team sits down to eat and are about to start when one of  them inquires  about the japanese man   oh we don t know what happened to him   explains the  american  he ran off into the woods to sort out the supplies  and hasn

other out right now   they agreed this is a good idea  the first psychiatrist confesses   i m a compulsive shopper and deeply in debt  so i usually overbill my patients as often as i can   the second admits   i have a drug problem that s out of control  and i frequently pressure my patients into buying illegal drugs for me   the third psychiatrist says   i know it s wrong  but no matter how hard i

aroma of his favorite sugar cookies wafting up the stairs he gathered enough strength to get out bed  leaning against the wall  he slowly made his way out of the bedroom with even greater effort  he forced his boney fingers to grab the handrail and he went down the stairs  one stumbling step at a time with labored breath  he leaned against the door frame  gazing into the kitchen  were it not for death s agony  he would have thought himself already in heaven there  on the kitchen table  spread out in rows upon wax paper  were literally hundreds of his favorite sugar cookies was it heaven  or  was it one final act of heroic love from his devoted wife of 60 years  seeing to it that he left this world a happy man mustering one great final effort  he lunged toward the table  landing on his knees in a rumpled posture his parched lips were slightly parted  the wondrous taste of the cookie was already in his mouth  seemingly bringing him back to life the aged and withered hand  driven by one last gritty effort  shakingly made its way towards a cookie at the edge of the table  when it was suddenly smacked with a spatula by his wife  stay out of those   she said   they re for the funeral   an old jewish man went to a diner every day for lunch  he always ordered the soup du jour  one day the manager asked him how he liked his meal  the old man replied  with yiddish accent

asked  when he came to hand him the bill   vas goot  but you could give maybe a little more bread   came the reply once again \\n\\nthe manager was obsessed with seeing this customer say that he is satisfied with his meal  so he went to the bakery  and ordered a six foot long loaf of bread  when the man came in as usual the next day  the waitress and the manager cut the loaf in half  buttered the entire length of each half  and laid it out along the counter  right next to his bowl of soup  the old man sat down  and devoured his bowl of soup  and both halves of the six foot long loaf of bread \\n\\nthe manager now thinks he will get the answer he is looking for  and when the old man came up to pay for his meal  the manager asked in the usual way   how was your meal today  sir  \\n\\nthe old jew replied   it vas goot as usual  but vy you are back to giving only two slices bread   one afternoon a carpet layer had just finished installing carpet for a lady  he stepped out for a smoke  only to realize that he had lost his cigarettes  in the middle of the room  under the carpet  was a bump \\n\\n no sense pulling up the entire floor for one pack of smokes   the carpet layer said to himself  so  he got out his hammer and flattened the hump \\n\\nas he was cleaning up  the lady came in   here   she said  handing him his pack of cigarettes   i found them in the hallway

prostitutes  wanna have a little fun   one day  she was talking to her preacher about this  he said he had two male parrots and all they did was read the bible  he thought perhaps they would be a good influence on the two females  so they put the four parrots together  so  the females yelled at the male parrots   we re prostitutes  wanna have a little fun   one male parrot said to the other   put the bibles away  we ve made it to heaven   a pair of birds were sitting on a branch of a tree when they see a turtle run past them  jump off the branch and flap his arms as hard as he can  he falls to the ground  the poor turtle repeats this process numerous times  and then one bird says to the other  dear  do you think we should tell him he s adopted   a police officer in a small town stopped a motorist who was speeding down main street   but officer   the man began   i can explain     just be quiet   snapped the officer   i m going to let you cool your heels in jail until the chief gets back      but officer  i just wanted to say       and i said to keep quiet  you re going to jail   a few hours later the officer looked in on his prisoner and said   lucky for you that the chief is at his daughter s wedding  he ll be in a good mood when he gets back    don t count on it   answered the fellow in the cell   i m the groom   a police officer sees a man driving around with a pickup truck full of penguins  he pulls the guy over and says   you can t drive around with penguins in this town  take them to the zoo immediately  the guy says okay  and drives away  the next day  the officer sees the guy still driving around with the truck full of penguins    and they re all wearing sunglasses  he pulls the guy over and demands   i thought i told you to take these penguins to the zoo yesterday  the guy replies   i did  today i m taking them to the beach   three turtles  joe  steve  and poncho  decide to go on a picnic  joe packs the picnic basket with cookies  bottled sodas  and sandwiches  the trouble is  the picnic site is 10 miles away  so the turtles take 10 whole days to get there  by the time they do arrive  everyone s whipped and hungry  joe takes the stuff out of the basket  one by one  he takes out the sodas and realizes that they forgot to bring a bottle opener  joe   steve beg poncho to turn back home and retrieve it  but poncho flatly refuses  knowing that they ll eat everything by the time he gets back  somehow  after about two hours  the turtles manage to convince poncho to go  swearing on their great grand turtles  graves that they won t touch the food  so  poncho sets off down the road  slow and steady  twenty days pass  but no poncho  joe and steve are hungry and puzzled  but a promise is a promise  another day passes  and still no poncho  but a promise is a promise  after three more days pass without poncho in sight  steve starts getting restless   i need food   he says with a hint of dementia in his voice   no   joe retorts   we promised   five more days pass  joe realizes that poncho probably skipped out to the burger king down the road  so the two turtles weakly lift the lid  get a sandwich  and open their mouths to eat  but then  right at that instant  poncho pops out behind a rock   just for that  i m not going   a preacher is buying a parrot  are you sure it doesn t scream  yell  or swear   asked the preacher  oh absolutely  it s a religious parrot   the storekeeper assures him  do you see those strings on his legs  when you pull the right one  he recites the lord s prayer  and when you pull on the left he recites the 23rd psalm   wonderful   says the preacher   but what happens if you pull both strings   i fall off my perch  you stupid fool   screeched the parrot  a woman and a baby come into the doctor s office  she is taken into an examining room and waits for the doctor  after arriving there  the doctor examines the baby  and finds him not gaining much weight and asks the woman   is he breast fed or on the bottle    oh   he is breast fed    replied the woman   well then  strip down to your waist   orders the doctor  she takes off her top and bra and sits on the examing table  the doc starts pressing  kneading and pinching both breasts for quite a while in a very detailed and thorough examination  the doc motions to her to get dressed  then the doctor says    no wonder this baby is so hungry  you don t have any milk   the woman with a wry grin on her face responds    well of course i don t    i m his aunt   but i m sure glad i brought him in   a man left work one friday afternoon  being payday  instead of going home  he stayed out the entire weekend hunting with the boys and spent his entire paycheck  when he finally appeared at home  sunday night  he was confronted by a very angry wife and was barraged for nearly two hours with a tirade befitting his actions  finally  his wife stopped the nagging and simply said to him   how would you like it if you didn t see me for two or three days   to which he replied   that would be fine with me   monday went by and he didn t see his wife  tuesday and wednesday came and went with the same results  thursday  the

bartender  i d like to buy everyone in the bar a drink and get one for yourself too   the bartender makes the drinks and everyone raises their glass and yells  cheers   and downs their drinks  the bartender says  that ll be  37 50   the drunk says   kiss my big white rear   cuz i don t have any money   this infuriates the bartender who then jumps over the bar and beats up the drunk and throws him out into the street  the next day the same drunk walks into the same bar and says   i d like to buy the whole bar a drink  and get one for yourself  too   the bartender figures that maybe he was a little hard on the guy the day before and decides to give the guy the benefit of the doubt  he makes the drinks and they all say   salute   and down the drinks  the bartender says   that ll be  42 50   the drunk replies by putting his thumb to his nose  wiggling his fingers  and making a loud raspberry noise followed by   i don t have any money and you can kiss my big white rear   this angers the bartender even more than the first time  he jumps over the bar and beats the drunk and throws him out into the street onto his face and kicks him a few times for good measure  the next day the same drunk walks into the same bar  but before he can say anything the bartender says   let me guess  you want to buy the whole bar a drink and i should get one for myself  too  right   the drunk replies

days per year available for work  there are 52 weeks per year in which you already have 2 days off per week  leaving 261 days available for work  since you spend 16 hours each day away fron work  you have used up 170 days  leaving only 91 days available you spend 30 minutes each day on coffee break which counts for 23 days each year  leaving only 68 days available  with a 1 hour lunch each day  you used up another 46 days  leaving only 22 days available for work  you normally spend 2 days per year on sick leave  this leaves you only 20 days per year available for work  we are off 5 holidays per year  so your available working time is down to 15 days  we generously give 14 days vacation per year which leaves only 1 day available for work and i ll be damned if you are going to take that

keeper grabbed him and dragged him into his office  the zookeeper explained to the mime that the zoo s most popular attraction  a gorilla named sparky  had died suddenly and the keeper was worried that attendance at the zoo would fall off without him  the zookeeper offered the mime a job to dress up as sparky until they could get a new gorilla  the mime accepted the next morning  the mime put on a gorilla suit and entered the cage before the crowd arrived  he discovered that it was a great job  he could sleep all he wanted  play and make fun of people and he was drawing bigger crowds than he ever did as a mime  however  eventually the crowds tired of him  and he was getting bored just swinging on tires  he began to notice that the people were paying more attention to the lion in the cage next to his  not wanting to lose the attention of his audience  he climbed to the top of his cage  crawled across a partition  and dangled from the top over the lion s cage  of course  this made the lion furious  but the crowd loved it  at the end of the day the zoo keeper was thrilled  and even gave the mime a raise for being such a good attraction  this went on for some time  the mime kept taunting the lion  the crowds grew larger  and his salary kept going up  then one terrible day when he was dangling over the furious lion  he lost his grip and fell  the mime was terrified  the lion gathered itself and prepared to pounce  the mime was so scared that he began to run round and round the cage with the lion close behind  when no help came  and the crowd looked on in shock  the mime started screaming and yelling help  help me   he screamed  but the lion was too quick and pounced  the mime found himself flat on his back looking up at the angry lion  who was just inches away from his face when he whispered   shut up you idiot  do you want to get us both fired  an arab diplomat visiting the us for the first time was being wined and dined by the state department \\n\\nthe grand

jews had to leave the vatican  naturally there was a big uproar from the jewish community  so the pope made a deal  he would have a religious debate with a member of the jewish community  if the jew won  the jews could stay  if the pope won  the jews would leave  the jews realized that they had no choice  so they picked an elderly aged man named moishe to represent them  rabbi moishe s latin wasn t very good   in fact  he knew very little  but he was a man of great faith and well respected in the jewish community  the pope agreed  what could be easier than a silent debate  \\n\\nthe day of the great debate came  moishe and the pope sat opposite each other for a full minute before the pope raised his hand and showed three fingers  moishe looked back at him and raised one finger  the pope waved his fingers in a circle around his head  moishe pointed to the ground where he sat  the pope pulled out a wafer and a glass of wine  moishe pulled out an apple  the pope stood up and said   i give up  this man is too good  the jews can stay   \\n\\nan hour later  the cardinals were all around the pope asking him what happened  the pope said   first i held up three fingers to represent the trinity  he responded by holding up one finger to remind me that there was still one god common to both our religions  then i waved my finger around me to show him that god was all around us  he responded by pointing to the ground and showing that god was also right here with us  i pulled out the wine and the wafer to show that god absolves us from our sins  he pulled out an apple to remind me of original sin  he had an answer for everything  what could i do   \\n\\nmeanwhile  the jewish community had crowded around moishe   what happened   they asked   well   said moishe   first he said to me that the jews had three days to get out of here  i told him that not one of us was leaving  then he told me that this whole city would be cleared of jews  i let him know that we were staying right here    and then   asked a woman   i don t know   said moishe   he took out his lunch and i took out mine   a man dies and goes to hell  satan greets him  shows him three doors  and says   you must spend the rest of eternity in one of the rooms behind these doors  look in each one and decide which one you want  the man opens the first door  and sees a bunch of people standing on their heads on a wooden floor  looking very uncomfortable  he opens the second door  and sees a bunch of people standing on their heads on a concrete floor  looking even more uncomfortable  finally  he opens the third door  and sees a bunch of people standing around chatting and drinking coffee  up to their knees in sewage  hmmm   he says   that looks bad  but it s better than the other two  i ll take the third door   satan smiles and shows him in ten minutes later satan walks back into the room and says   alright  coffee break s over  everyone back on your heads   the policeman signals to an car driver to pull over to the side of the road  due to the fact that he appears to be driving erratically  he says to the driver   you appear to have been drinking   the driver answers   no sir  i am just tired  the policeman looks into the car and notices that the driver is a priest  he also notices that there is an empty bottle on the floor  he says to the driver   what is  or should i say was in this bottle the driver answers   water   the policeman says   it is not  it s wine  the driver looks up to the heavens and says   oh lord  you have done it again   this door to door entrepreneur

cruise ship in the caribbean  the audience would be different each week  so the magician allowed himself to do the same tricks over and over again  there was only one problem  the captain s parrot saw the shows each week and began to understand how the magician did every trick  once he understood he started shouting in the middle of the show   look  it s not the same hat   look  he is hiding the flowers under the table   hey  why are all the cards the ace of spades    the magician was furious but couldn t do anything  it was  after all  the captain s parrot  one day the ship had an accident and sank  the magician found himself on a piece of wood in the middle of the ocean with the parrot  of course  they stared at each other with hatred  but did not utter a word  this went on for a day and then another and another  after a week the parrot said   ok  i give up  where s the boat   two military policemen were chasing a fleeing draftee from the military base  the draftee ran into the courtyard of a convent  he saw a nun seated on a round bench beneath a tree  quietly reading a book \\n\\nhe said to her   quick sister  please hide me i don t want to be drafted and the m p  s are chasing me  \\n\\nshe lifted up her skirt and said   quick hide under here   the two policemen came by and asked if she had seen anyone  she replied   no  \\n\\nafter they left she told the young boy to come out and that everything was going to be ok  he thanked her and said   you have a nice set of legs for a nun  \\n\\nshe replied   if you reach up a little farther you ll find a nice set of balls too  i m not going to be drafted either   a man with a winking problem is applying for a position as a sales representative for a large firm  the interviewer looks over his papers and says   this is phenomenal  you ve graduated from the best schools  your recommendations are wonderful  and your experience is unparalleled  normally  we d hire you without a second thought  however  a sales representative has a highly visible position  and we re afraid that your constant winking will scare off potential customers  i m sorry   we can t hire you  \\n\\n but wait   he said   if i take two aspirin  i ll stop winking  \\n\\n really  great  show me  \\n\\nso the applicant reaches into his jacket pocket and begins pulling out all sorts of condoms  red condoms  blue condoms  ribbed condoms  flavored condoms  finally  at the bottom  he finds a packet of aspirin  he tears it open  swallows the pills  and stops winking \\n\\n well   said the interviewer   that s all well and good  but this is a respectable company  and we will not have our employees womanizing all over the country  \\n\\n womanizing  what do you mean  i m a happily married man  \\n\\n well then  how do you explain all these condoms  \\n\\n oh  that   he sighed   have you ever walked into a pharmacy  winking  and asked for aspirin   during the great depression  there was a man who walked into a bar one day  he went up to the bartender and said   bartender  i d like to buy the house a round of drinks   the bartender said   that s fine  but we re in the middle of the depression  so i ll need to see some money first   the guy pulled out a huge wad of bills and set them on the bar  the bartender can t believe what he s seeing   where did you get all that money   asked the bartender   i m a professional gambler   replied the man  the bartender said   there s no such thing  i mean  your odds are fifty fifty at best  right    well  i only bet on sure things   said the guy   like what   asked the bartender   well  for example  i ll bet you fifty dollars that i can bite my right eye   he said  the bartender thought about it   okay   he said  so  the guy pulled out his false right eye and bit it   aw  you screwed me   said the bartender  and paid the guy his  50   i ll give you another chance  i ll bet you another fifty dollars that i can bite my left eye   said the stranger  the bartender thought again and said   well  i know you re not blind  i mean  i watched you walk in here  i ll take that bet   so  the guy pulled out his false teeth and bit his left eye   aw  you screwed me again   protested the bartender   that s how i win so much money  bartender  i ll just take a bottle of your best scotch in lieu of the fifty dollars   said the man  with that  the guy went to the back room and spent the better part of the night playing cards with some of the locals  after many hours of drinking and card playing  he stumbled up to the bar  drunk as a skunk  he said   bartender  i ll give you one last chance  i ll bet you five hundred dollars that i can stand on this bar on one foot and piss into that whiskey bottle on that shelf behind you without spilling a drop   the bartender once again pondered the bet  the guy couldn t even stand up straight on two feet  much less one   okay  you re on   he said  the guy climbed up on the bar  stood on one leg  and began pissing all over the place  he hit the bar  the bartender  himself  but not a drop made it into the whiskey bottle  the bartender was ecstatic  laughing  the bartender said   hey pal  you owe me five hundred dollars   the guy climbed down off the bar and said   that s okay  i just bet each of the guys in the card room a thousand bucks each that i could piss all over you and the bar and still make you laugh   bernie and

one tenth that hard   a drunk was staggering down the main street of town  somehow he managed to make it up the stairs to the cathedral and into the building  where he crashed from pew to pew  finally making his way to a side aisle and into a confessional a priest had been observing the man s sorry progress and figuring that the fellow was in need of some assistance  proceeded to enter his side of the confessional  but his attention was rewarded only by a lengthy silence  finally he asked   may i help you  my son   i dunno     came the drunk s voice from behind the partition   you got any

noticed that airman jones was having a staggeringly high success rate  selling insurance to nearly 100  of the recruits he advised  rather than asking him about this  the captain stood at the back of the room and listened to jones  sales pitch  jones explained the basics of gi insurance to the new recruits  and then said   if you are killed in a battle and have a gi insurance  the government has to pay  200 000 to your beneficiaries  but  if you don t have a gi insurance and get killed in the battle  the government only has to pay a maximum of  6000    now   he concluded   which group do you think they are going to send into battle first   an american man  a russian man  and an african man were all up in a hot air balloon together  after a few minutes  the russian man put his hand down through the clouds   aaah   he said   we re right over my homeland   how can you tell   asked the american  i can feel the cold air   he replied a few hours later the african man put his hand through the clouds   aah we re right over my homeland   he said  how do you know that   asked the russian   i can feel the heat of the desert  several more hours later the american put his hand through the clouds   aah  we re right over new york  the russian and the african were amazed   how do you know all of that   they exclaimed the american pulled his hand up   my watch is missing   a man returns to

accountant he is replacing  on the last day the departing accountant tells him that he has left two envelopes in the desk drawer and that the envelope number 1 should be opened if he ever encounters any sort of crisis in the job and envelope number 2 if a further crisis occurs  three months down the track there is a major drama  all the accounts are wrong   the usual stuff   and the accountant feels very threatened by it all  he remembers the parting words of his predecessor and finds and opens the first envelope  the message inside says  blame me   he does this and gets off the hook  three months later at his next crisis he opens the second envelope  the message inside says  write two envelopes   it is the olympic men s figure skating  out comes the russian competitor  he skates around to some classical music in a slightly dull costume  performs some excellent leaps but without any great artistic feel for the music  \\n\\nthe judges  scores read  britain 5 8  russia 5 9  united states 5 5  ireland 6 0 \\n\\nnext comes the american competitor in a sparkling stars and stripes costume  skating to some rock and roll music  he gets the crowd clapping  but is not technically as good as the russian  he slightly misses landing a triple salchow and loses the center during a spin  but  artistically  it is a more satisfying performance  \\n\\nthe judges  scores read  britain 5 8  russia 5 5  united states 5 9  ireland 6 0 \\n\\nfinally out comes the irish competitor wearing a tatty old donkey jacket  with his skates tied over his wellies  he reaches the ice  trips straight away and bangs his nose which starts bleeding  he tries to get up  staggers a few paces then slips again  he spends his entire  routine  getting up then falling over again  finally he crawls off the ice a tattered and bleeding mess  \\n\\nthe judges  scores read  britain 0 0  russia 0 0  united states 0 0  ireland 6 0 \\n\\nthe other 3 judges turn to the irish judge and demand in unison   how the

team    pass     our story begins at the olympics  specifically the wrestling event  it is narrowed down to the russian or the american for the gold medal  \\n\\nbefore the final match  the american wrestler s trainer came to him and said   now don t forget all the research we ve done on this russian  he s never lost a match because of this  pretzel  hold he has  whatever you do  don t let him get you in this hold  if he does  you re finished   \\n\\nthe wrestler nodded in agreement  now  to the match the american and the russian circled each other several times looking for an opening  all of a sudden the russian lunged forward  grabbing the american and wrapping him up in the dreaded pretzel hold  a sigh of disappointment went up from the crowd  and the trainer buried his face in his hands for he knew all was lost  he couldn t watch the ending  \\n\\nsuddenly there was a scream  a cheer from the crowd  and the trainer raised his eye just in time to see the russian flying up in the air  the russian s back hit the mat with a thud  and the american weakly collapsed on top of him  getting the pin and winning the match  \\n\\nthe trainer was astounded  when he finally got the american wrestler alone  he asks   how did you ever get out of that hold  no one has ever done it before   the wrestler answered   well  i was ready to give up when he got me in that hold  but at the last moment  i opened my eyes and saw this pair of balls right in front of my face  \\n\\n i thought i had nothing to lose  so with my last ounce of strength i stretched out my neck and bit those babies just as hard as i could  \\n\\n you d be amazed how strong you get when you bite your own balls   on the farm lived a chicken and a horse  both of whom loved to play\\ntogether  one day  the two were playing  when the horse fell into a bog and began to sink   scared for his life  the horse whinnied for the chicken to go get the farmer for help  off the chicken ran  back to the farm  \\n  \\narriving at the farm  he searched and searched for the farmer  but to no\\navail  for he had gone to town with the only tractor   running around  the\\nchicken spied the farmer s new harley  finding the keys in the ignition  the\\nchicken sped off with a length of rope hoping he still had time to save his\\nfriend s life  \\n  \\nback at the bog  the horse was surprised  but happy  to see the chicken arrive on the shiny harley  and he managed to get a hold of the loop of rope the chicken tossed to him  after tying the other end to the rear bumper of the farmer s bike  the chicken then drove slowly forward and  with the aid of the powerful bike  rescued the horse  happy and proud  the chicken rode the harley back to the farmhouse  and the farmer was none the wiser when he returned  \\n  \\nthe friendship between the two animals was cemented   best buddies  best\\npals  \\n  a few weeks later  the chicken fell into a mud pit  and soon  he too \\nbegan to sink and cried out to the horse to save his life   the horse\\nthought a moment  walked over  and straddled the large puddle  looking\\nunderneath  he told the chicken to grab his hangy down thing and he could\\nthen lift him out of the pit  the chicken got a good grip  and the horse\\npulled him up and out  saving his life  \\n \\n  the moral of the story    yes  there s a moral     \\n    \\n\\n when you re hung like a

clothing so that they think you re a pauper   his accountant told him  joseph decided to ask his lawyer as well   wear your best clothing so they know you aren t intimidated   the lawyer said  completely confused  joseph went to his priest and told him about the conflicting advice he had received  asking for his advice   let me tell you a story   the priest said   a woman  about to be married  asked her mother what she should wear on her wedding night and was told to wear a heavy  long  flannel nightgown that covered her all the way up to her neck  she also asked her best friend  who told her to wear a sexy negligee with a v neck down to her navel   joseph was confused   what does any of that have to do with my problem with the irs    simple   replied the priest   it doesn t

sailing the seven seas  his lookout spotted a pirate ship approaching  and the crew became frantic  captain bravado bellowed   bring me my red shirt   the first mate quickly retrieved the captain s red shirt  and while wearing the brightly colored frock  the captain led his crew into battle and defeated the mighty pirates  that evening  all the men sat around on deck recounting the triumph of earlier  one of them asked the captain   sir  why did you call for your red shirt before battle   the captain replied   if i were to be wounded in the attack  the shirt would not show my blood  thus  you men would continue to fight  unafraid   all of the men sat and marveled at the courage of such a manly man s man  as dawn came the next morning  the lookout spotted not one  not two  but ten pirate ships approaching  the crew stared in worshipful silence at the captain and waited for his usual orders  captain bravado gazed with steely eyes upon the vast armada arrayed against his ship  and without fear  turned and calmly shouted   get me my brown pants   an alien and a man were sitting next to each other in a bar  the alien was constantly poking the guy s cheek and saying   zzzt

 and people at the windows realize that they re headed straight for the water at the edge of  the airport territory  as it begins to look as though the plane will never take off  that it will plow into the water  panicked screams fill the cabin  but at that moment  the plane lifts smoothly into the air  the passengers relax and laugh a little sheepishly  and soon they have all retreated into their magazines  secure in the knowledge that the plane is in good hands  up in the cockpit  the copilot turns to the pilot and says   you know  bob  one of these days  they re going to scream too late  and we re all gonna die       a man walks into the market followed by his ten year old son  the kid is spinning a 25 cent piece in the air and catching it between his teeth  as they walk through the market someone bumps into the boy at just the wrong moment and the coin goes straight into his mouth and lodges in his throat  he immediately starts choking and going blue in the face and dad starts panicking  shouting and screaming for help \\n\\na middle aged  fairly unremarkable man in a gray suit is sitting at a coffee bar in the market reading his newspaper and sipping a cup of coffee  at the sound of the commotion he looks up  puts his coffee cup down on the saucer  neatly folds his newspaper and places it on the counter  he gets up from his seat and makes his unhurried way across the market  reaching the boy  who is still standing  but just barely  the man carefully takes hold of the kid s testicles and squeezes gently but firmly  after a few seconds the boy convulses violently and coughs up the 25 cent piece  which the man catches in his free hand  releasing the boy  the man hands the coin to the father and walks back to his seat in the coffee bar without saying a word \\n\\nas soon as he is sure that his son has suffered no lasting ill effects  the father rushes over to the man and starts effusively thanking him  the man looks embarrassed and brushes off the father s thanks  as the man is about to leave  the father asks one last question   i ve never seen anybody do anything like that before  it was fantastic   what are you  a surgeon or something like that  \\n\\n oh  good heavens  no   the man replies   i work for the irs   a limousine had encountered a red traffic light and was waiting for it to change when a small mini also drives up  the

limo  a few days passed  and again the limo was at a traffic light when the businessman spotted the mini  it was pulled over to a side  with the glass all steamed up  and steam coming from a half open

farmer goes out one day and buys a brand new stud rooster for his chicken coop  the young rooster walks over to the old rooster and says   ok  old fellow  time to retire  the old rooster says   you can t handle all these chickens     look at what it did to me  the young rooster replies   now  don t give me a hassle about this  time for the old to step aside and the young to take over  so take a hike  the old rooster says   aw  c mon      just let me have the two old hens over in the corner  i won t bother you  the young rooster says   scram  beat it  you re washed up  i m taking over  the old rooster thinks for a minute and then says to the young rooster   i ll tell you what  young fellow  i ll have a race around the farmhouse with you  whoever wins the race gets domain of the chicken coop  the young rooster says   you know i m going to beat you  old man so just to be fair  i m even going to give you a head start  they line up in back of the farm house  get a chicken to cluck  go   and the old rooster takes off running  about 15 seconds later the young rooster takes off after him  they round the front of the farm house and the young rooster is only about 5 inches behind the old rooster and gaining fast  the farmer  sitting on the porch  looks up  sees what s going on  grabs his shotgun and boom       he blows the young rooster to bits he sadly shakes his head and says   damnit  third gay rooster i bought this week   one day  down in the mystical forest  a magical frog was hopping towards a water hole  the forest was so enormous that the frog had never laid eyes on another animal before  but today  by chance a bear was chasing after a rabbit to have for dinner  \\n\\nthe frog called for the two to stop and said   because you are the only two animals i have seen  i will grant both of you three wishes  bear  you can go first   the bear thought for a moment  and being the male he was  said   i wish for all the bears in this forest  apart from me  to be female   \\n\\nfor his wish  the rabbit asked for a crash helmet  and immediately put it on  the bear was amazed at the stupidity of the rabbit  wasting his wish like that  \\n\\nit was the bear s second turn for a wish   well  i wish that all the bears in the next forest were female as well   \\n\\nthe rabbit asked for a motorcycle and immediately hopped on it and roared the engine  the bear was shocked that the rabbit was asking for such idiotic items  because after all  he could have asked for money and bought the bike  \\n\\nfor the last wish the bear thought for a while and then said   i wish that all the bears in the world  apart from me  were female   \\n\\nthe rabbit grinned  roared the engine  and said   i wish that the bear was gay   a man and a woman  who have never met before  find themselves assigned to thesame sleeping room on a transcontinental train though initially embarrassed and uneasy over sharing a room  the two aretired and fall asleep quickly   he in the upper bunk and she in the lower at 1 00 am  he leans over and gently wakes the woman saying   ma am  i msorry to bother you  but would you be willing to reach into the closet toget me a second blanket  i m awfully cold   i have a better idea   she replies   just for tonight  let s pretend that we re married   wow  that s a great idea    he exclaims  good   she replies   get your own damn blanket  after a moment of silence  he farted  moses and jesus were in a threesome playing golf one day  moses pulled up to the tee and drove a long one  the ball landed in the fairway  but rolled directly toward a water hazard  quickly moses raised his club  the water parted and it rolled to the other side  safe and sound  next  jesus strolled up to the tee and hit a nice long one directly toward the same water hazard  it landed right in the centre of the pond and kind of hovered over the water  jesus casually walked out on the pond and chipped the ball onto the green  the third guy got up and randomly whacked the ball  it headed out over the fence and into oncoming traffic on a nearby street  it bounced off a truck and hit a nearby tree  from there  it bounced onto the roof of a shack close by and rolled down into the gutter  down the drain spout  out onto the fairway and straight toward the aforementioned pond  on the way to the pond  the ball hit a stone and bounced out over the water onto a lily pad  where it rested quietly  suddenly a very large bullfrog jumped up on a lily pad and snatched the ball into his mouth  just then  an eagle swooped down and grabbed the frog and flew away  as they passed over the green  the frog squealed with fright and dropped the ball  which bounced right into the cup for a hole in one  moses turned to jesus and said   i hate playing with your dad   a young woman  who was at her father s funeral  asked her mother   mom  how did dad die    her mom replied   heart attack     what was he doing   the daughter asked   her mother said   well  we were having sex  \\n\\nthis infuriated the daughter  because they were both 80 years old   the daughter said   you guys are 80 years old   you should have expected something like this   you re way too old to be engaging in this sort of activity    the mom replied   well  you see  years ago  we realized that at noon every day  the church bells rang   so  we decided to work along to that nice  slow rhythm so that your father wouldn t have a heart attack   it worked for years too \\nthat poor guy    he d still be alive today if that darned ice cream truck hadn t come along     john was on his way to work  he got on his bus and sat down  after a while there is a small bump  john   what was that   driver   it was a cat  john   why did you run it over   driver   well it was either that or swerve into the tree at the side of the road and kill us all   john   oh  fair enough  a little farthur down the road the bus swerves suddenly and a bigger bump shakes the bus  john   what was that     driver   it was a dog  john   why did you run it over   driver  i couldn t help it  i tried to swerve but i hit it by accident  john   that s awful but i suppose you did try to swerve  the bus continued on its journey but later on it swerved again and there was a small bump followed by a large thud  john   what is it this time   driver   i hit an old lady  john   oh my god  is she alright  driver   no she s lying in a pool of blood by the side of the road   john   i can t believe this  why did this have to happen on my journey   the driver called for an ambulence and the bus set off again  when john got off the bus  he asked the driver   if the big bump was the old lady  what was the small one   the driver simply replied  i had to go on the pavement to get her   arthur davidson

\\n\\n watch and you ll see   answers one of the scotsmen \\n\\nthey all board the train  the englishmen take their respective seats but all three scotsmen cram into a toilet and close the door behind them  shortly after the train has departed  the conductor comes around collecting tickets  he knocks on the toilet door and says   ticket  please   the door opens just a crack and a single arm emerges with a ticket in hand  the conductor takes it and moves on \\n\\nthe english saw this and agreed it was quite a clever idea  so after the conference  the englishmen decide to copy the scots on the return trip and save some money  when they get to the station  they buy a single ticket for the return trip  to their astonishment  the scots don t buy a ticket at all \\n\\n how are you going to travel without a ticket   asks one perplexed englishman \\n\\n watch and you ll see   says one of the scotsmen  when they board the train the three scots cram into a toilet and the three englishmen cram into another one nearby \\n\\nthe train departs  shortly afterward  one of the scots leaves his restroom and walks over to the restroom where the englishmen are hiding  he knocks on the door and says   ticket  please   an englishman and a scotsman are driving head on   at night  on a twisty  dark road  both are driving too fast for the conditions and collide on a sharp bend in the road  to the amazement of both  they are unscathed  though their cars are both destroyed in celebration of their luck  both agree to put aside their dislike for the other from that moment on at this point  the scotsman goes to the boot and fetches a 12 year old bottle of sherry  he hands the bottle to the englishman  whom exclaims    may the scots and the english live together forever  in peace  and harmony    the englishman then tips the bottle and gulps half of the bottle down  still flabbergasted over the whole thing  he goes to hand the bottle to the scotsman  whom replies     no thanks  i ll just wait till the police get here   a jewish man and a chinese man were conversing  the jewish man commented \\nupon what a wise people the chinese are \\n yes   replied the chinese   our culture is over

them they will be whipped for entering their territory  the tribe chief says to the candian   what do you want on your back for your whipping  the canadian responds   i will take oil  so they put oil on his back  and a large amazon whips him 10 times when he is finished the canadian has these huge welts on his back  and he can hardly move the amazons haul the canadian away  and say to the mexican  what do you want on your back   i will take nothing   i will take my punishment like a real man   says the mexican  and he boldly stands there and takes his 10 lashings without a single flinch finally  it s the yank s turn and the tribal chief asks  what will you take on your back  and he responds     i ll take the mexican    little johnny and jenny are only 10 years old  but they just know that

love and i want to ask you for her hand in marriage   thinking that this was the cutest thing  mr  smith replies   well johnny  you are only 10  where will you two live   without even taking a moment

bucks a month  and that should do us just fine   by this time mr  smith is a little shocked that johnny has put so much thought into this  so  he thinks for a moment trying to come up with something that johnny won t have an answer to  after a second  mr  smith says   well johnny  it seems like you have got everything all figured out  i just have one more question for you  what will you do if the two of you should have little ones of your own   johnny just shrugs his shoulders and says  well  we ve been lucky so far     a guy was sitting quietly reading his paper when his wife walked up behind him and whacked him on the head with a magazine  \\n\\n what was that for   he asked  \\n\\n that was for the piece of paper in your pants pocket with the name mary lou written on it   she replied  \\n\\n two weeks ago when i went to the races  mary lou was the name of one of the horses i bet on   he explained  \\n\\n oh honey  i m sorry   she said    i should have known there was a good explanation   \\n\\nthree days later he was watching a ballgame on tv when she walked up and hit him in the head again  this time with the iron skillet  which knocked him out cold   when he came to  he asked   what the hell was that for   \\n\\nshe replied   your horse called   a fireman is at the station house working outside on the fire truck when he notices a little girl next door  the little

\\n\\nthe little girl says  i m pretending to be a fireman and this is my fire truck   \\n\\nthe fireman walks over to take a closer look   little girl that sure is a nice fire truck   the fireman says  \\n\\n thanks mister  says the little girl  \\n\\nthe fireman looks a little closer and notices the little girl has tied the dog to the wagon by its testicles  \\n\\n little girl   says the fireman   i don t want to tell you how to run your fire truck  but if you were to tie that rope around the dog s neck i think you could go faster   \\n\\nthe little girl says   you re probably right mister  but then i wouldn t have a siren   john was a clerk in a small drugstore but he was not much of a salesman  he could never find the item the customer wanted  bob  the owner  had about enough and warned john that the next sale he missed would be his last  just then a man came in coughing and he ask john for their best cough syrup  try as he might john could not find the cough syrup  remembering bob s warning he sold the man a box of ex lax and told him to take it all at once  the customer did as john said and then walked outside and leaned against a lamp post  bob had seen the whole thing and came over to ask john what had transpired   he wanted something for his cough but i couldn t find the cough syrup  i substituted ex lax and told him to take it all at once  john explained   ex lax won t cure a cough   bob shouted angrily   sure it will  john said  pointing at the man leaning on the lamp post   just look at him  he s afraid to cough   this guy sits down at the bar and orders 5 shots of tequila and downs them straight  the bartender impressed asks  hey buddy did you have a long day   \\n\\nthe man replies that he just found out that his brother was gay and leaves  \\n\\nthe next day the same guy comes in and orders ten shots  the bartender asks if he is still dealing with his brothers sexual orientation and the man replies  no i just found out my son is gay too   \\n\\nthe bartender is appropriatly sympathetic and the man leaves  \\n\\nthe third night the man comes in and orders 25 shots and downs them all  stunned the bartender asks  damn man doesn t anyone in your family likes women  \\n\\nthe man forcefully replies  well apparently my wife does   a young gay man calls home and tells his jewish mother that he has decided to go back into the closet because he has met a wonderful girl  and they are going to be married  he tells his mother that he is sure she will be happier since he knows that his gay lifestyle has been very disturbing to her she responds that she is indeed delighted and asks tentatively   i suppose it would be too much to hope that she would be jewish  he tells her that not only is the girl jewish but from a wealthy beverly hills family  she admits she is overwhelmed by the news  and asks   what is her name  he answers   monica lewinsky  there is a pause  then his mother asks   what happened to that nice black boy you were dating last year   one day an out of work mime is visiting the zoo and attempts to earn some money as a street performer  however  as soon as he starts to draw a crowd  the zookeeper grabs him and drags him into his office  the zookeeper explains to the mime that the zoo s most popular attraction  a gorilla  has died suddenly  the keeper fears that attendance at the zoo will fall off  he offers the mime a job to dress up as the gorilla until they can get another one  the mime accepts  the next morning  before the crowd arrives  the mime puts on the gorilla suit and enters the cage  he discovers that it s a great job  he can sleep all he wants  play and make fun of people and he draws bigger crowds than he ever did as a mime  however  eventually the crowds tire of him and he gets bored just swinging on tires  he begins to notice that the people are paying more attention to the lion in the cage next to his  not wanting to lose the attention of his audience  he climbs to the top of his cage  crawls across a partition  and dangles from the top to the lion s cage  of course  this makes the lion furious  but the crowd loves it  at the end of the day the zookeeper comes and gives the mime a raise for being such a good attraction as a gorilla  well  this goes on for some time  the mime keeps taunting the lion  the crowds grow larger  and his salary keeps going up  then one terrible day when he is dangling over the furious lion  he slips and falls  the mime is terrified  the lion gathers itself and prepares to pounce  the mime is so scared that he begins to run round and round the cage with the lion close behind  finally  the mime starts screaming and yelling   help  help me    but the lion is quick and pounces  the mime soon finds himself flat on his back looking up at the angry lion and the lion says   shut up you idiot  do you want to get us both fired   two aliens landed in the arizona desert near an abandoned gas station \\n\\nthey approached one of the gas pumps and one of the aliens addressed it \\n\\n greetings  earthling  we come in peace  take us to your leader  \\n\\nthe gas pumps of course didn t respond  the alien repeated the greeting  again there was no response  the alien  annoyed by what he perceived to be the gas pumps haughty attitude  drew his ray gun and said impatiently   greetings earthling  we come in peace  how dare you ignore us in this way  take us to your leader or i ll fire  \\n\\nthe other alien shouted to his comrade   no  you don t want to make him mad  \\n\\nbut before he finished his warning the first alien fired  there was a huge explosion that blew both of them 200 meters into the desert  where they landed in a heap rather abruptly  when they finally regained consciousness  the one who fired turned to the other one and said   what a ferocious creature  it damn near killed us  how did you know it was so dangerous   \\n\\nthe other alien answered   if there s one thing i ve learned during my travels

minutes later the doorbell rings and there is another man  he says  my name s freddy and im here for betty and we re going to go eat some spaghetti   once again the farmer okays everything and they go along on their merry way  ten minutes later the door belll rings again and the farmer opens the door the farmer says you must be here for cindy  the man at the door says  yes actually  my name s chuck and were going to go   the farmer shot him  a guy was in a supermarket when he noticed an old lady following him around  whenever he stopped  she stopped  and she also kept staring at him  she finally overtook him just before the checkout where she turned to him and said  \\n\\n i hope i haven t made you feel uncomfortable   it s just that you look so much like my late son   \\n\\n oh  that s ok   he said  \\n\\n i know it s silly   she continued   but if you called out  goodbye  mother  as i leave  it would make me ever so happy   the old lady proceeded through the checkout and as she left the supermarket  the man called out  goodbye mother   the old lady waved back  and kindly smiled  \\n\\npleased he had brought a bit of sunshine to someone s day the man went to pay for his groceries  \\n\\n that ll be 105 dollars 35   said the clerk  \\n\\n how come   inquired the man   i ve only bought a few things   \\n\\n yeah  but your mother said you d pay for her     an american was backpacking across the highlands  when he came across a small village where he decided to spend the night upon entering the local pub that evening for some drinks with the locals  he found himself in

the restroom \\n\\nthe bartender replied   i really don t think you should     why not   the nun asked \\n\\n well  there is a statue of a naked man in there  and his most private parts are covered only by a fig leaf  \\n\\n nonsense   said the nun   i ll just look the other way  \\n\\nso  the bartender showed the nun the door at the top of the stairs  and she preceded to the restroom  after a few minutes  she came back out  and the whole place was hopping with music and dancing again  however  they did stop just long enough to give the nun a loud round of applause \\n\\nshe went to the bartender and said   sir  i don t understand  why did they applaud for me just because i went to the restroom  \\n\\n well  now they know you re one of us   said the bartender   would you like a drink

the chest and walks to the casino  the deep voice says  roulette  so he changes all the gold into a huge pile of roulette tokens and goes to one of the tables  where the players gaze at him with disbelief  the deep voice says  27  he takes the whole pile and drops it at the 27  the table nearly bursts  everybody is quiet when the croupier throws the ball  the ball stops at the 26 the deep voice says  damn  god called down to adam   my child  i have noticed you are lonely down there  so i want you to meet someone  come and see  i call her woman  her name is eve    adam came to see her  he then returned to speak with god  hardly able to contain his excitement  oh  father  she is so beautiful  her shining blonde hair  and those gorgeous eyes  why did you make her so beautiful  god answered   so that you would love her my son  but check out the smell of that shining blonde hair     adam leaves and later returns to speak with god   oh my lord  she smells like the flowers in the garden of eden in the sunshine just after the rain  why did you make her smell so good god   he answered    and again god answered him   so that you would love her my son    she will keep you company when you feel like you need a friend  go forth and enjoy her my son  see how much fun you can have together hours later  adam returns  completely shagged out  father  she has many great qualities  the sex was great she can please me greatly physically  i enjoyed that immensely  but father  why is she so dumb   to which god replied   so that she would love you my son  70 year old george went for his annual physical  all of his tests came back with normal results  dr  smith said   george  everything looks great physically  how are you doing mentally and emotionally  are you at peace with yourself

his ten fruits were berries  when the king explained the trial to the second man  he secretly thought to it would be easy to shove the berries up his butt  on the ninth berry  he burst out in laughter

     the black bear said   that was a very bad mistake   that was my cousin  i m going to give you two choices   either i maul you to death or we have sex       after considering briefly  bob decided to accept the latter alternative   so the black bear had his way with  bob  even though he felt sore for two weeks  bob soon recovered and vowed revenge   he headed out on another trip to alaska where he found the black bear and shot it dead   right after  there was another tap on his shoulder  this time a huge grizzly bear stood right next to him     the grizzly said   that was a big mistake  bob   that was my cousin and you ve got two choices  either i maul you to death or i have sex with you   again  bob thought it was better to cooperate with the grizzly bear than be mauled to death   so the grizzly had his way with bob       although he survived  it took several months before bob fully recovered   now bob was completely outraged  so he headed back to alaska and managed to track down the

anything  there s going to be a string attached  two old pensioners are taking a trip down memory lane by going back to the place where they first met  \\n\\nsitting at a café  the little old man says   remember the first time i met you over 50 years ago  we left this cafe  went round the corner behind the gas works  and i gave you one from behind   \\n\\n why  yes  i remember it well  dear   replies the little old lady with a grin  \\n\\n well  for old time s sake  let s go there again  and i ll give you one from behind   \\n\\nthe two pensioners pay their bill and leave the cafe  a young man sitting next to them has overheard the conversation and smiles to himself  thinking it would be quite amusing to see two old pensioners at it  he gets up and follows them  sure enough  he sees the two pensioners near the gas works  the little old lady pulls off her knickers and lifts up her dress  \\n\\nthe old man pulls down his pants and grabs the lady s hips  and the little old lady reaches for the fence  well  what follows is 40 minutes of the most athletic sex the man has ever seen  the little old man is banging away at the little old woman at a pace that can only be described as phenomenal  limbs are flying everywhere  the movement is a blur  and they do not stop for a single second  finally  they collapse and don t move for an hour  \\n\\nwell  the man is stunned  never in his life has he ever seen anything that equates to this    not in the movies  not from his friends  not from his own experiences  \\n\\nreflecting on what he has just seen  he says to himself   i have to know his secret  if only i could shag like that now  let alone in 50 years  time   \\n\\nthe two old pensioners have by this time recovered and dressed themselves  plucking up courage  the man approaches the pensioner  \\n\\nhe says   sir  in all my life i have never seen anybody shag like that  particularly at your age  what s your secret  could you shag like that 50 years ago   \\n\\nthe pensioner replies   son  50 years ago  that goddamn fence wasn t electrified   a couple was invited to a swanky masked halloween party  the wife got a terrible headache and told her husband to go to the party alone  he  being a devoted husband  protested  but she argued and said she was going to take some aspirin and go to bed  and there was no need of his good time being spoiled by not going  so he took his costume and away he went  the wife  after sleeping soundly for one hour  awakened without pain  as it was still early  she decided to go to the party  since her husband did not know what her costume was  she thought she would have some fun watching him to see how he acted when she was not with him  she joined the party and soon spotted her husband cavorting around on the dance floor  dancing with every nice woman he could  copping a little feel here and a little kiss there  his wife sidled up to him  as a rather seductive babe herself  he left his partner high and dry and devoted his time to the new stuff that had just arrived  she let him go as far as he wished  naturally  since he was her husband  finally he whispered a little proposition in her ear and she agreed  so off they went to one of the cars and had sex  just before unmasking at midnight  she slipped away  went home  put the costume away and got into bed  wondering what kind of explanation he would make for his behavior  she was sitting up reading when he came in and she asked how the party was  he said   oh  the same old thing  you know i never have a good time when you re not there   then she asked   did you dance much   he replied   i ll tell you  i never even danced one dance  when i got there  i met pete  bill brown and some other guys  so we went into the den and played poker all evening  but i ll tell you    the guy i loaned my costume to sure had a really good time   a very shy guy goes into a bar and sees a beautiful woman sitting at the bar  after an hour of gathering up his courage  he finally goes over to her and asks  tentatively   um  would you mind if i chatted with you for a while  she responds by yelling  at the top of her lungs   no  i won t sleep with you tonight   everyone in the bar is now staring at them  naturally  the guy is hopelessly and completely embarrassed and he slinks back to his table after a few minutes  the woman walks over to him and apologizes  she smiles at him and says   i m sorry if i embarrassed you  you see  i m a graduate student in psychology  and i m studying how people respond to embarrassing situations  to which he responds  at the top of his lungs   what do you mean  200    britney spears had just bought her new car and decided to go shopping with her friend and rival  christina aguilera  a few hours later she came out and realizes she had locked her keys in the car  so they spent a few hours pacing around the car trying to figure out what to do  \\n\\n\\nfinally  britney looked off into the distance and saw storm cloud  she turned to her friend and said   quick  think of something because a storm is coming and i left the top open   an officer is sent to a new base and he meets with one of the soldiers  he says  everything is alright around here but what s up with the camel    the soldier replies  well the soldiers are lonely and sometimes they get uh   urges   the officer is disgusted but thinking it over he replies  i guess it makes sense  keep it  a couple of weeks later the officer calls in the soldier and says  i m getting restless  send in the camel   the soldier comes into his tent with the camel and leaves  after the officer is done with his business and zips up  the soldier walks in and asks  what were you just doing    and the officer replies  well isn t this how you  ride  one of these    the soldier says  well  usually me and the guys ride the camel into town and get some chicks   there s an english man  irish man and a scotsman  they re being chased by a policeman  they see this old warehouse so they run in  inside there are 3 empty sacks on the floor  they each jump in a sack  in comes the copper and see s these three bundles on the floor  goes up to the first one and kicks it  the english man shout out   woof woof   and the copper thinking it s just an old dog leaves it and kicks the second sack  the scotsman yells out   me ow me ow   he leaves this one as well thinking its just an old cat  he walks over to the last sack and kicks it  and the irish man yells out    potatoes potatoes     a cute little old lady goes to the doctor and says   doctor i have this problem with gas  but it really doesn t bother me too much  it never smells and is always silent  as a matter of fact i ve farted at least 10 times since i ve been here in your office  you didn t know i was farting because it doesn t smell and is silent   the doctor says   i see  take these pills and come back to see me next week   the next week the lady returns   doctor   she says   i don t know what the heck you gave me  but now my farts  although still silent  stink terribly    good   the doctor said   now that we ve cleared up your sinuses  let s work on your hearing   three engineers and three accountants are traveling by train to a conference  at the station  the three accountants each buy tickets and watch as the three engineers buy only a single ticket  how are three people going to travel on only one ticket   asks an accountant   watch and you ll see   answers an engineer  they all board the train  the accountants take their respective seats but all three engineers cram into a restroom and close the door behind them shortly after the train has departed  the conductor comes around collecting tickets  he knocks on the restroom door and says   ticket  please   the door opens just a crack and a single arm emerges with a ticket in hand  the conductor takes it and moves on the accountants saw this and agreed it was quite a clever idea  so after the conference  the accountants decide to copy the engineers on the return trip and save some money  being clever with money  and all   when they get to the station they buy a single ticket for the return trip to their astonishment  the engineers don t buy a ticket at all   how are you going to travel without a ticket   asked one perplexed accountant  watch and you ll see   answered an engineer  when they board the train the three accountants cram into a restroom and the three engineers cram into another one nearby  the train departs shortly afterward  one of the engineers leaves his restroom and walks over to the restroom where the accountants are hiding  he knocks on the door and says   ticket  please   a female reporter was conducting an interview with a farmer about mad cow disease   mr  brown  do you have any idea what might be the cause of the disease   \\n\\n sure  do you know the bulls only impregnate the cows once a year   \\n\\n umm  sir  that is a new piece of information  but what s the relationship between this and mad cow  \\n\\n and did you know we milk the cows twice a day   \\n\\n mr  brown  that s interesting  but  what s the point   \\n\\n lady  the point is this  if i m playing with your breasts twice a day  but only made love to you once a year  wouldn t you go mad  too   there were these two cows  chatting over the fence between their fields \\nthe first cow said   i tell you  this mad cow disease is really pretty\\nscary   they say it is spreading fast  i heard it hit some cows down on the\\njohnson farm    \\nthe other cow replies   hell  i ain t worried  it don t affect us ducks   a man goes into a restaurant with his wife  the waiter approaches the table and asks for their order   i ll have your biggest  juiciest steak   he says  \\n\\n but sir  what about the mad cow    asks the waiter  \\n\\n oh   answers the man   she ll order for herself   a nice young man wanted to purchase a christmas\\ngift for his new sweetheart  as they had not been dating very long \\nafter some careful consideration  he decided that a pair of elegant winter gloves would strike just the right note   romantic  but not too personal \\n\\naccompanied by his sweetheart s younger sister  he went to a\\nfine department store and chose a pair of lovely white fur lined gloves  the sister did her own shopping  buying a pair of panties for herself  \\n\\nwhile the clerk was wrapping the items  she got the boxes mixed up  and gave the gloves to the sister and gift wrapped the panties for the young man \\n\\nthe young man sealed the package without noticing and sent it to his sweetheart  who opened it on christmas to find his enclosed note \\n\\n\\ni chose these because i noticed that you are not in the habit of wearing any when we go out in the evening  if it had not been for your sister  i would have chosen the long ones with the  buttons  but she demonstrated the short ones she wears that are easier to remove \\nthese are a delicate shade  but the lady i bought them from\\nshowed me the pair she had been wearing for the past three weeks and they were hardly soiled  i had her try yours on for me and she looked very sharp \\n\\ni wish i was there to put them on for you the first time  as no doubt other hands will come in contact with them before i have a chance to see you again  when you take them off  remember to blow in them before putting them away  as they will naturally be a little damp from wearing \\n\\njust think how many times i will kiss them during the coming\\nyear  i hope you will wear them for me on friday night  \\nall my love  \\n\\n p s    the latest style is to wear them folded down with a little fur showing  a little rabbit is happily running through the forest when he stumbles upon a giraffe rolling a joint  the rabbit looks at her and says   giraffe my friend  why do you do this  come with me running through the forest  you ll see  you ll feel so much better   the giraffe looks at him  looks at the joint  tosses it and goes off running with the rabbit \\n\\nthen they come across an elephant doing coke  so the rabbit again says   elephant my friend  why do you do this  think about your health  come running with us through the pretty forest  you ll see  you ll feel so good   the elephant looks at them  looks at his razor  mirror and all  then tosses them and starts running with the rabbit and giraffe \\n\\nthe three animals then come across a lion about to shoot up and the rabbit again says   lion my friend  why do you do this  think about your health  come running with us through the sunny forest  you will feel so good  \\n\\nthe lion looks at him  puts down his needle  and starts to beat the hell out of the rabbit  as the giraffe and elephant watch in horror  they look at him and ask   lion  why did you do this  he was merely trying to help us all  \\n\\nthe lion answers   that little fruitcake  he makes me run around the forest like an idiot each time he s on ecstasy   two beautiful statues in a park  facing each other across the grass  one of a young girl and the other of a young man  looking towards each other like young lovers  these statues gave so much pleasure to people visiting the park that god looked down and decided to reward them with life for 30 minutes  on a sunday when the park was closed to the public  immediately when they came alive  they ran together into the bushes and could be heard giggling and cooing with pleasure and the bushes were shaking  after 15 minutes they came out and realised that they still had 15 minutes more life to live   what shall we do now then  said the boy statue   let s do the same thing again  she replied   okay   said the boy statue   but this time  you hold the pigeons down while i poop on them   a man lay sprawled across three entire seats in a theater  when the usher came by and noticed this  he whispered to the man   sorry  sir  but you re only allowed one seat   the man groaned but didn t budge  the usher became impatient   sir  if you don t get up from there i m going to have to call the manager   again  the man just groaned  which infuriated the usher who turned and marched briskly back up the aisle in search of his manager  in a few moments  both the usher and the manager returned and stood over the man  together the two of them tried repeatedly to move him  but with no success  finally  they summoned the police  the cop surveyed the situation briefly then asked   all right buddy  what s your name    sam   the man moaned   where ya from  sam   with pain in his voice sam replied

behind him   my elbow hurts like hell  i guess i better see a doctor   listen  you don t have to spend that kind of money   mike replies   there s a diagnostic computer at the drugstore at the corner  just give it a urine sample and the computer ll tell you what s wrong and what to do about it  it takes ten seconds and costs ten dollars   a hell of a lot cheaper than a doctor  so jack deposits a urine sample in a small jar and takes it to the drugstore  he deposits ten dollars  and the computer lights up and asks for the urine sample  he pours the sample into the slot and waits ten seconds later  the computer ejects a printout  you have tennis elbow  soak your arm in warm water and avoid heavy activity  it will improve in two weeks that evening while thinking how amazing this new technology was  jack began wondering if the computer could be fooled  he mixed some tap water  a stool sample from his dog  urine samples from his wife and daughter  and masturbated into the mixture for good measure jack hurries back to the drugstore  eager to check the results  he deposits ten dollars  pours in his concoction  and awaits the results the computer prints the following 1  your tap water is too hard  get a water softener 2  your dog has ringworm  bathe him with anti fungal shampoo 3  your daughter has a cocaine habit  get her into rehab 4  your wife is pregnant   twin girls  they aren t yours  get a lawyer 5  if you don t stop playing with yourself  your elbow will never get better  heaven is when you have   an american salary   a british home   chinese food   a swiss

\\n\\n mrs  jones   the doctor asks \\n\\n yes  doctor  what s happened  how is my husband                          \\n\\nthe doctor sits next to her and says   not good news  i m afraid  your husband s accident resulted in two fractures of his spine  \\n\\n oh my god   says mrs  jones   what is the prognosis  \\n\\n well  mrs  jones  the good news is his vital signs are stable  however  his spine is inoperable  he ll have no motor skills or capability  this means you will have to feed him  \\n\\nmrs  jones begins to sob   \\n\\n and you ll have to turn him in his bed every two hours to prevent pneumonia  \\n\\nmrs  jones begins to wail and cry loudly   \\n\\n then  of course   the doctor continued   you ll have to diaper\\nhim as he ll have no control over his bladder and  of course  these diapers must be changed at least five times a day  \\n\\nmrs  jones begins to shake as she cries  sobs  wails    the doctor continues \\n\\n and you ll have to clean up his feces on a regular basis

group of golfers   the engineer fumed   what s with these guys  we must have been waiting for 15 minutes   the doctor chimed in   i don t know  but i ve never seen such ineptitude  the pastor said   hey  here comes the greenskeeper  let s have a word with him    dramatic pause   hi george  say  what s with that group ahead of us  they re rather slow  aren t they  the greenskeeper replied   oh  yes  that s a group of blind firefighters   they lost their sight saving our clubhouse from a fire last year  so we always let them play for free anytime   the group was silent for a moment  the pastor said   that s so sad  i think i will say a special prayer for them tonight   the doctor said   good idea  and i m going to contact my ophthalmologist buddy and see if there s anything he can do for them   the engineer said   why can t these guys play at night   a woman was distraught at the fact that she had not had a date or any sex in \\nquite some time  she was afraid she might have

you have three whishes   the genie says \\n\\nthe irish man thinks for a little while  and then he says   i would like to have a bottle of the finest whisky in the world  and that no matter how much i drink from it  it will never empty  \\n\\nimmediately after finishing his sentence  a bottle of great whisky falls into the irishman s hand  \\nhe starts drinking it  taking one big gulp after another  \\nbut then  after finishing drinking  he finds that the bottle is still completely full  \\n\\n well  what are your next two wishes    asks the jiny \\n\\n i would like two more bottles just like

the man says   there was this old lady  i came out of a store and found her surrounded by a dozen hell s angels  they had taken her purse and were shoving her around  taunting and abusing her  i got so mad i threw my bags down  fought through the crowd  and got her purse back  i then helped her to her feet  i then went up to the biggest  baddest biker and told him how despicable  cowardly and mean he was and then spat in his face    wow   said peter   that s impressive  when did this happen    oh  about 10 minutes ago   replied the man  the local sheriff was looking for a deputy  so gomer   who was not exactly the sharpest nail in the bucket went in to try out for the job   okay   the sheriff drawled   gomer  what is 1 and 1    11  he replied  the sheriff thought to himself   that s not what i meant  but he s right    what two days of the weekstart with the letter  t     today and tomorrow   he was again surprised that gomer supplied a correct answer that he had never thought of himself   now gomer  listen carefully  who killed abraham lincoln   gomer looked a little surprised himself  then thought really hard for a minute and finally admitted   i don t know    well  why don

i d like to try the bet  after the laughter had died down  the bartender said ok  grabbed a lemon  and squeezed away  then he handed the wrinkled remains of the rind to the little man  but the crowd s laughter turned to total silence as the man clenched his fist around the lemon and six drops fell into the glass  as the crowd cheered  the bartender paid the  1000  and asked the little man  what do

the left with some rope  then i sat down and continued to milk her  just as i got the bucket about full she took her right leg and kicked it over ” “again ” the farmer says  “some things you just can’t explain ” “so  what did you do then ” the man asked  intrigued  “i took her right leg and tied it to the post on the right  i sat back down and continued to milk her  and just as i got the bucket just about full  the stupid cow knocked over the bucket with her tail ” “wow  you must have been pretty upset ” but that’s no reason to just sit here getting all depressed ” the farmer says  “some things you just can’t explain ” “so then what else did you do ” the man asked again “well i didn’t have any more rope  so i took off my belt and tied her tail to the rafter  that’s when my pants

said   since i control everything and do all the thinking  i should be the boss  \\n\\nthe feet said   since i carry man where he wants to go and get him in position to do what the brain wants  then i should be the boss  \\n\\nthe hands said   since i must do all the work and earn all the money to keep the rest of you going  i should be the boss  \\n\\nand so it went with the eyes  the heart  the

spoke   that s twice    you know  that mule hadn t gone a half mile when it stumbled a third time    my wife promptly removed a gun from her purse  hopped off the beast  and shot the mule dead     i protested over her treatment of the mule  she slowly turned tome and quietly said   that s once   three friends were backpacking through europe and found out about a magical mountain near the coast  so they decided to check it out \\nwhen they finally reached the top of the mountain they saw a man jump straight off the edge and screamed that he wanted to be an eagle then poof he turned into an eagle and flew away \\nafter seeing that the three friends got really excited and decided to go for it the first thought for a second and then dashed straight off and yelled  i want to be a hawk  then poof he turned into a hawk and flew away  the second friend thought for a second and finally decided and jumped off and yelled  i want to be a a mountain goat  then poof he turned into a mountain goat and ran away  the third friend thought about for a long while and then finally decided  he ran as fast as he could ready to jump but then slipped on loose rocks and fell off the yelling  ohh

on the fat lady  who in turn must have slapped his face  \\n2  the fat lady thought    that dirty old american laid his hands on the blonde and she smacked him  \\n3  the american thought    that

the other whether there was baseball in heaven or not one night cliff dies in his sleep after watching a chicago white sox game    chicago won  so at least he died a happy man  the next day cliff

important to them we will look first at what food can be added to ourdiet that will help relieve stress the food in question  is chocolate  this overlookedfood is considered unhealthy  but let s take a look chocolate is made from sugar and cocoa beans withthe bean known as a vegetable  sugar is derived mainly from sugar cane  this would also be in the vegetable category  thus classifying allchocolate as a vegetable  chocolate covered raisins  cherries  orange slices and strawberries all count as fruit  and as you well know you are encouraged to eat as much fruit as you want to take this one step further  milk chocolate contains milk  which is dairy  therefore  chocolate  in any form  should be considered a health food  so remember   stressed spelled backward is

year  decade and probably the century a charlotte  nc  lawyer purchased a box of very rare and expensive cigars then insured them against fire among other things  within a month having smoked his entire stockpile of these great cigars and without yet having made even his first premium payment on the policy  the lawyer filed claim against the insurance company in his claim  the lawyer stated the cigars were lost  in a series of small fires  the insurance company refused to pay  citing the obvious reason  that the man had consumed the cigars in the normal fashion  the lawyer sued    and won in delivering the ruling the judge agreed with the insurance company that the claim was frivolous  the judge stated nevertheless  that the lawyer held a policy from the company in which it had warranted that the cigars were insurable and also guaranteed that it would insure them against fire without defining what is considered to be unacceptable fire   and was obligated to pay the claim rather than endure lengthy and costly appeal process  the insurance company accepted the ruling and paid  15 000 00 to the lawyer for his loss of the rare cigars lost in the  fires  now for the best part    after the lawyer cashed the check  the insurance company had him arrested on 24 counts of arson     with his own insurance claim andtestimony from the previous case being used against him  the lawyer was convicted of intentionally burning his insured property and was sentenced to 24 months in jail and a  24 000 00 fine this is a true story and was the 1st place winner in the recent criminal lawyers award contest only in america a fishy tale far away in the tropical waters of the caribbean  two prawns were swimming around in the sea   one called justin and the other called christian the  prawns were constantly being harassed and threatened by sharks that patrolled the area   finally one day justin said to christian   i m bored and frustrated at being a prawn  i wish i was a shark  and then i wouldn t have any worries about being eaten    as justin had his mind firmly on becoming a predator  a mysterious cod appears and says   your wish is granted   and lo and behold  justin turned into a shark horrified  christian immediately swam away  afraid of being eaten by his old mate   time went on  as it invariably does     and justin found himself becoming bored and lonely as a shark   all his old mates simply swam away whenever he came close to them   justin didn t realise that his new menacing appearance was the cause of his sad plight while out swimming alone one day he sees the mysterious cod again and can t believe his luck justin figured that the fish could change him back into a prawn   he begs the cod to change him back so  lo and behold  he is turned back into a prawn   with tears of joy in his tiny little eyes  justin swam back to his friends and bought them all a cocktail   the punch line does not involve a prawn cocktail   it s much worse  looking around the gathering at the reef  he searched for his old pal   where s christian   he asked   he s at   home  distraught that his best friend changed sides to the enemy and became a shark   came the reply eager to put things right again and end the mutual pain and torture  he set off to christian s house   as he opened the coral gate the memories came flooding back   he banged on the door and shouted   it s me  justin  your old friend  come out and see me again  christian replied  no way man  you ll eat me  you re a shark  the enemy and i ll not be tricked   justin cried back  no  i m not   that was the old me   i vechanged                                  i ve found cod   i m a prawn again christian  one day a horse and a chicken were walking along on the farm  talking quietly to themselves  all of a sudden  the horse falls into a hole that he didn t see  \\n\\nthe horse says to the chicken   go get the farmer  he ll know what to do   so  the chicken runs off \\n\\nabout 10 minutes later  the horse hears a car  and he sees the chicken s head peer over the top of the hole  the chicken says   i couldn t find the farmer  but i got his car  hold this rope  and i ll try to drag you out   so  after a few minutes  the horse was safely out of the hole \\n\\nabout a month later  both had forgotten all about the hole  they were once again talking and walking about the farm  when all of a sudden  the chicken falls into the same hole  the chicken says to the horse   go get the farmer  he ll know what to do   \\n\\nbut the horse walks around the hole and says   i think i can stand over the hole  grab my thingy  and i ll pull you out   and so  about 5 minutes later  the chicken was safely out of the hole \\n\\nthis time  they remembered the hole  and never got stuck again \\n\\nmoral

joe and john  joe was the owner of a dilapidated old boat  it so happened that john s wife died the same day that joe s boat sank  a few days later  a kindly old woman saw joe a mistook him for john  she said   i m sorry to hear about your loss  you must just feel terrible  joe thinking that she was talking about his boat  said   hell no in fact is i m sort of glad to be rid of her  she was a rotten old thing right from the beginning  her bottom was all shriveled up and she smelled like old dead fish  she was always losing her water  she had a bad crack in the back and a pretty big hole in the front too  every time i used her  her hole got bigger and she leaked like crazy i guess what finally finished her off was when i rented her to these four guys looking for a good time  i warned them that she wasn t very good  but they wanted to use her anyhow  the fools tried to get in her all at once and she split right up the middle   the old lady fainted  a man goes to the hosital because he is having pains in his stomach  he tells the doc what is wrong and the doc says  you have constipation  you will need to take one of these suppository s every 6 hours for a week  i can help you with the first one   so  reluctantly  the man drops his pants  bends over  and the doc shoves it in  later  at home  he is having a little trouble inserting the next one  so he asks his wife for help  he tells her what to do  drops his pants and bends over  she then puts one hand on his shoulder and starts pushing it in   damn   the guy screams   what  did i hurt you   his wife replies   no   said the man  but i just realized something   the doctor put 2 hands on my shoulders     little leroy went to his mother demanding a new bicycle  his mother decided that he should take a look at himself and the way he acts  she said   well  leroy  it isn t christmas and we don t have the money to just go out and buy you anything you want  why don t you write a letter to jesus and pray for one instead  \\n\\nafter leroy threw a temper tantrum  his mother sent him to his room  where he finally sat down to write a letter to jesus \\n\\ndear jesus  i ve been a good boy this year and would appreciate a new bicycle  your friend  leroy \\n\\nnow  leroy knew that jesus really understood what kind of boy he was   a brat   so leroy ripped up the letter and decided to give it another try \\n\\ndear jesus  i ve been an ok boy this year  and i want a new bicycle  yours truly  leroy\\n\\nwell  leroy knew this wasn t totally honest either  so he tore it up and tried again \\n\\ndear jesus  i ve thought about being a good boy this year  and can i have a bicycle  leroy\\n\\nleroy looked deep down into his heart  which  by the way  was what his mother really wanted   he knew he had been terrible and was deserving of almost nothing  he crumpled up the letter  threw it in the trash can  and went running outside  he aimlessly wandered about the streets  depressed because of the way he had treated his parents  for the first time  he really considered his actions \\n\\nleroy finally found himself in front of a catholic church  he went inside and knelt down  looking around but not knowing what he should really do  leroy finally got up and began to walk out the door and was looking at all the statues  all of a sudden  he grabbed a small statue and ran out the door  he went home  hid it under his bed  and wrote this letter \\n\\njesus  i ve got your mama  if you ever want to see her again  give me a bike  from  you know who    this guy met a woman at a bar and she took him home to have sex  afterwards when he is getting dressed  he sees a picture of some guy on her dresser \\nhe asks her who the picture is of and she replies   don t worry about it  \\nhe then says   well is that your husband  \\nshe says that it is not \\n well  is that your boyfriend  \\nagain she says no \\nthe guy then says   well then  who the hell is it  \\nshe replies   it was me before my operation   a san diego patrolman pulled over a driver and told him that because he was wearing his seat belt  he had just won  5000 in a safety competition   what are you going to do with the money   the officer asked

door his wife is standing there all pissed off  she says  and where were you   he replies i was at  the bar and i met this gorgeous woman and she invited me up to her place for drinks and a night of

old man visits his doctor and after a thorough examination  the doctor tells him   i have good news and bad news  what would you like to hear first  patient  well  give me the bad news first doctor  you have cancer  i estimate that you have about two years left patient  that s terrible  in two years  my life will be over  what kind of good news could you probably tell me  after this doctor  you also have alzheimer s  in about three months you are going to forget everything i told you  1 star hangover     no pain   no real feeling of illness  you slept in your own bed and when you woke up there were no traffic cones in there with you   you are still able to function relatively well on the energy stored up from all those vodka red bulls  however  you can drink 10 bottles of water and still feel as parched as the sahara  even vegetarians are craving a cheeseburger and a side of fries 2 star hangover       no pain  but something is definitely amiss  you may look okay but you have the attention span and mental capacity of a stapler    the coffee you hug to try and remain focused is only exacerbating your rumbling gut  which is craving a full english breakfast  although you have a nice demeanour about the office  you are costing your employer valuable money because all you really can handle is some light filing  followed byaimlessly surfing the net and writing junk e mails 3 star hangover         slight headache  stomach feels crap  you are definitely a space cadet and not so productive  anytime a girl or lad walks by you gag because her perfume   aftershave reminds you of the random gin shots you did with your alcoholic friends  after the bouncer kicked you out at 1 45 a m  life would be better right now if you were in your bed with a dozen doughnuts and a litre of coke watching daytime tv  you ve had 4 cups of coffee  a gallon of water  2 sausage rolls and a litre of diet coke yet you haven t peed once 4 star hangover           you have lost the will to live  your head is throbbing and you can t speak too quickly or else you might spew  your boss has already lambasted you for being late and has given you a lecture for reeking of booze  you wore nice clothes  but you smell of socks  and you can t hide the fact that you either missed an oh so crucial spot shaving or it looks like you put your make up on while riding the dodgemsdepending on your gender  your teeth have their own individual sweaters  your eyeslook like one big vein and your hairstyle makes you look like a reject from the second grade class picture circa 1976  you would give a week s pay for one of the following home time  doughnut and somewhere to be alone  or a time machine so you could go back and not have gone out the night before  you scare small children in the street just by walking past them 5 star hangover             you have a second heartbeat in your head  which is actually annoying the employee who sits next to you  vodka vapour is seeping out of every pore and making you dizzy  you still have toothpaste crust in the corners of your mouth from brushing your teeth  your body has lost the ability to generate saliva  so your tongue is suffocating you  you d cry but that would take the last of the moisture left in your body     death seems pretty good right now  your boss doesn t even get mad at you and your co workers think that your dog just died because you look so pathetic    you should have called in sick because  let s face it  all you can manage to do is breathe     very gently 6 star hangover               you arrive home and climb into bed  sleep comes instantly  as you were fighting it all the way home in the taxi   you get about 2 hours sleep until the noises inside your head wake you up   you notice that your bed has been cleared for take off and is flying relentlessly around the room  no matter what you do you now  you re going to chuck  you stumble out of bed and now find that your room is in ayacht under full sail  after walking along the skirting boards on alternating walls knocking off all the pictures  you find the toilet  if you are lucky you will remember to lift the lid before you spontaneously explode and wake the whole house up with your impersonation of walrus mating calls  you sit there on the floor in your undies  cuddling the only friend in the world you have left  the toilet   randomly continuing to make the walrus noises  spitting  and farting   help usually comes at this stage  even if it is short lived  tears stream down your face and your abdomen hurts  help now turns into abuse and he she usually goes back to bed leaving you there in the dark  with your stomach totally empty  your spontaneous eruptions have died back to 15 minute intervals  but your body won t relent  you are convinced that you are starting to turn yourself inside out and swear that you saw your tonsils projectile out your mouth on the last occasion  it is now dawn and you pass your disgusted partner getting up for the day as you try to climb into bed    she   he abuses you again for trying to get into bed with lumpy bits of dried vomit in your hair  you reluctantly accept their advice and have a shower in exchange for them driving you to the hospital  work is not an option  three guys  a canadian  bin laden  and uncle sam are given one wish each by an arabian genie the canadian says    my family has been in farming for ten generations  i wish for all canadian land to be fertile  poof he gets his wish bin laden says    i love the land i live in and i don t want any horrors to enter  i wish for a wall to be built around afghanistan  poof he gets his wish uncle sam says    tell me more about this wall   well  it is ten feet thick  4 000 feet high and inpenetrable   fill it with water   once upon a time there lived a woman who had a maddening passion for baked beans  she loved them but unfortunately they had always had a very embarrassing and somewhat lively reaction to her  then one day she met a guy and fell in love  when it became apparent that they would marry she thought to herself    he is such a sweet and gentle man  he would never go for this carrying on   so she made the supreme sacrifice and gave up beans  some months later her car broke down on the way home from work  since she lived in the country she called her husband and told him that she would be late because she had to walk home  on her way she passed a small diner and the odor of the baked beans was more than she could stand  since she still had miles to walk  she figured that she would walk off any ill effects by the time she reached home  so  she stopped at the diner and before she knew it  she had consumed three large orders of baked beans  all the way home she putt putted  and upon arriving home she felt reasonably sure she could control it  her husband seemed excited to see her and exclaimed delightedly   darling  i have a surprise for dinner tonight   he then blindfolded her and led her to her chair at the table  she seated herself and just as he was about to remove the blindfold from his wife  the telephone rang  he made her promise not to touch the blindfold until he returned  he then went to answer the phone  the baked beans she had consumed were still affecting her and the pressure was becoming almost unbearable  so while her husband was out of the room she seized the opportunity  shifted her weight to one leg and let it go  it was not only loud  but it smelled like a fertilizer truck running over a skunk in front of pulpwood mill  she took her napkin and fanned the air around her vigorously  then  she shifted to the other cheek and ripped three more  which reminded her of cabbage cooking  keeping her ears tuned to the conversation in the other room  she went on like this for another ten minutes  when the phone farewells signaled the end of her freedom  she fanned the air a few more times with her napkin  placed it on her lap and folded her hands upon it  smiling contentedly to herself  she was the picture of innocence when her husband returned  apologizing for taking so long  he asked her if she peeked  and she assured him that she had not  at this point  he removed the blindfold  and she was surprised    there were twelve dinner guests seated around the table to wish her a happy birthday    a guy goes into a costume shop  he says   i m going to a halloween\\nparty  and i want to go as adam  \\n\\nthe girl brings out a fig leaf \\n\\nbut he says   not big enough  \\n\\nso she brings out a bigger one \\n\\n still not big enough  \\n\\nso she

mean you want a divorce   the teacher gave her fifth grade class an assignment \\nget their parents to tell them a story with a moral at the end of it  the\\nnext day the kids came back and one by one began to tell their stories \\nashley said   my father s a farmer and we have a lot of egg laying  hens \\none time we were taking our eggs to market in a basket on the front seat \\nof the car when we hit a big bump in the road and all the eggs went flying \\nand broke and made a mess  \\n what s the moral of the story   asked the teacher \\n don t put all your eggs in one basket  \\n very good   said the teacher \\n\\nnext little sarah raised her hand and said   our family are farmers too \\nbut we raise chickens for the meat market  we had a dozen eggs one time \\nbut when they hatched we only got ten live chicks  and the moral to this\\nstory is   don t count your chickens before they re hatched  \\n that was a fine story sarah  michael  do you have a story to share  \\nyes  my daddy told me this story about my uncle mike  uncle mike was a flight engineer in the gulf war and his plane got hit  he had to bail out over enemy territory and all he had was a bottle of whiskey  a machine \\n gun and a machete  he drank the whiskey on the way down so it wouldn t break and then he landed right in the middle of 100 enemy troops  he killed seventy of them with the machine gun until he ran out of bullets  then he killed twenty more with the machete until the blade broke  and then he\\nkilled the last ten with his bare hands  \\n\\ngood heavens   said the horrified teacher   what kind of moral did your \\ndaddy tell you from that horrible story    stay the hell away from uncle mike when he s been drinking   a man with a bald head and a wooden leg gets invited to a fancy costume party  he doesn t know what costume to wear to hide his head and his leg   so he writes to a fancy dress company to explain the problem a few days later he receives a parcel with a note   dear sir  please find enclosed a pirates outfit  the spotted handkerchief will cover your bald head and with your wooden leg you will be just right as a pirate   the man thinks this is terrible because they have just emphasized his wooden leg  so he writes a rude letter of complaint a week passes and he receives another parcel and a note which says  dear sir  sorry about before  please find enclosed a monk s habit  the long robe will cover your wooden leg and with your bald head you will really look the part   now the man is really annoyed since they have gone from emphasizing his wooden leg to emphasizing his bald head and he writes the company a really rude letter of complaint the next day he receives a small parcel and a note which reads  dear sir  since we have not been able to make you happy  this is our last suggestion  please find enclosed a bottle of molasses  pour the molasses over your bald head  stick your wooden leg up your ass  and go as a caramel apple   it was autumn  and the indians on a remote reservation asked their newchief if the winter was going to be cold or mild since he was an indian chief in a modern society he had never beentaught the old secrets  so when he looked at the sky he couldn t tell what theweather was going to be nevertheless  to be on the safe side  he replied to his tribe that thewinter was indeed going to be cold and that the members of the villageshould collect wood to be prepared but also being a practical leader  after several days he got an idea he went to the phone booth  called the national weather service andasked   is the coming winter going to be cold   it looks like this winter is going to be quite cold indeed   the meteorologist at the weather service responded  so the chief went back to his people and told them to collect even more wood in order to be prepared one week later he called the national weather service again   is it going to be a very cold winter   yes   the man at national weather service again replied   it s going to be a very cold winter  the chief again went back to his people and ordered them to collect every scrap of wood they could find two weeks later he called the national weather service again   are youabsolutely sure that the winter is going to be very cold   absolutely   the man replied   it s going to be one of the coldest winters ever   how can you be so sure   the chief asked the weatherman replied   the indians are collecting wood like crazy   on a visit to my wife s native england for our honeymoon  we arrived \\nat london s gatwick airport  my wife headed for the british

tried all the tactics we could remember from movies to figure out\\nwhat direction we were headed  moss on the trees  there wasn t any  the\\ndirection of the sun  it was heavily overcast \\n\\njust as we were about to panic  my brother in law spotted a cabin off\\nin the distance  he pulled out his binoculars and studied it closely \\nwith a cry of  a ha   he turned and led us right back to our camp \\n\\n that was fantastic   i said   how did you do it  \\n\\n simple   he replied   in this part of the country all the satellite\\ndishes point south   a man is in bed with his wife when there is a knock at the door  he rolls over and looks at his clock  and it s 3 30 in the morning   i m not getting out of bed at this time   he thinks  and rolls over  then a louder knock follows   aren t you going to answer that   says his wife  so he drags himself out of bed and goes downstairs  he opens the door and there is a man standing on the porch  it didn t take the homeowner long to realize the man was drunk   hi there   slurs the stranger   can you give me a push     no  get lost  it s half past three  i was in bed   says the man and he slams the door  he goes back up to bed and tells his wife what happened and she says   that wasn t very nice of you  remember that night we broke down in the pouring rain on the way to pick the kids up from the babysitter and you had to knock on that man s house to get us started again  what would have happened if he d told us to get lost    but the guy was drunk   says the husband   it doesn t matter   says the wife   he needs our help and it would be the christian thing to help him   so the husband gets out of bed again  gets dressed  and goes downstairs  he opens the front door  and not being able to see the stranger anywhere he shouts   hey  do you still want a push   and he hears a voice cry out   yeah  please   so  still being unable to see the stranger he shouts   where are you   and the drunk replies   over here  on the

can tell the penguin what is wrong with his car  the penguin agrees and goes for a walk  he finds an ice cream shop and thinks a big bowl of vanilla ice cream will really hit the spot since he s a penguin and it s arizona in the summer  after all  he sits down at the counter and starts in on his ice cream  of course he has no hands so it is rather messy  by the time he is done he has ice cream all over his flippers and his mouth   a total mess  he walks back to the service station and says to the mechanic   did you find out what is wrong with my car   the mechanic replies   it looks like

otherwise  the work poop is inevitable  for those who hate pooping at work  following is the 2001 survival guide for taking a dump at work  memorize these definitions and pooping at work will become a pure pleasure escapee definition  a fart that slips out while taking a leak at the urinal or forcing a poop in a stall  this is usually accompanied by a sudden wave of panic embarrassment  this is similar to the hot flash you receive when passing an unseen police car and speeding  if you release an escapee  do not acknowledge it  pretend it did not happen  if you are standing next to the farter in the urinal  pretend you did not hear it  no one likes an escapee  it is uncomfortable for all involved  making a joke or laughing makes both parties feel uneasy jailbreak  used in conjunction with escapee  definition  when forcing poop  several farts slip out at a machine gun pace  this is usually a side effect of diarrhea or a hangover  if this should happen  do not panic  remain in the stall until everyone has left the bathroom so to spare everyone the awkwardness of what just occurred courtesy flush definition  the act of flushing the toilet the instant the nose cone of the poop log hits the water and the poop is whisked away to an undisclosed location  this reduces the amount of air time the poop has to stink up the bathroom  this can help you avoid being caught doing the walk of shame walk of shame definition  walking from the stall  to the sink  to the door after you have just stunk up the bathroom  this can be a very uncomfortable moment if someone walks in and busts you  as with all farts  it is best to pretend that the smell does not exist  can be avoided with the use of the courtesy flush out of the closet pooper definition  a colleague who poops at work and damn proud of it  you will often see an out of the closet pooper enter the bathroom with a newspaper or magazine under their arm  always look around the office for the out of the closet pooper before

whereabouts of out of the closet poopers  and identify safe havens safe havens definition  a seldom used bathroom somewhere in the building where you can least expect visitors  try floors that are predominantly of the opposite sex  this will reduce the odds of a pooper of your sex entering the bathroom turd burglar definition  a pooper who does not realize that you are in the stall and tries to force the door open  this is one of the most shocking and vulnerable moments that can occur when taking a dump at work  if this occurs  remain in the stall until the turd burglar leaves  this way you will avoid all uncomfortable eye contact camo cough definition  a phony cough that alerts all new entrants into the bathroom that you are in a stall  this can be used to cover up a watermelon  or to alert potential turd burglars  very effective when used in conjunction with an astaire astaire definition  a subtle toe tap that is used to alert potential turd burglars that you are occupying a stall  this will remove all doubt that the stall is occupied  if you hear an astaire  leave the bathroom immediately so the pooper can poop in peace watermelon definition  a turd that creates a loud splash when hitting the toilet water  this is also an embarrassing incident  if you feel a watermelon coming on  create a diversion  see camo cough havana omelet definition  a load of diarrhea that creates a series of loud splashes in the toilet water  often accompanied by an escapee  try using a camo cough with an astaire uncle ted definition  a bathroom user who seems to linger around forever  could

bathroom is empty  this benefits you as well as the other bathroom attendees fly by definition  the act of scouting out a bathroom before pooping  walk in and check for other poopers  if there are others in the bathroom  leave and come back again  be careful not to become a frequent flyer  people may become suspicious if they catch you constantly going into the bathroom  there was this magician

the audience  after the parrot told the audience  the ship hit an iceberg and started to sink  everyone ran to the life boats  it so happen that the magician went overboard and managed to hold one a flat piece of board that the parrot was on  after three days of staring at each other the parrot finally says  ok  what did you do with the ship   three sons left home  went out on their own and prospered  getting back together  they discussed the gifts they were able to give their elderly mother  the first said   i built a big house for our mother   the second said   i sent her a mercedes   the third smiled and said   i ve got you both beat  you remember how mom enjoyed reading the bible  and you know she can t see very well  so i sent her a remarkable parrot that recites the entire bible  it took elders in the church 12 years to teach him  he s one of a kind  mom just has to name the chapter and verse  and the parrot recites it   soon thereafter  mom sent out her letters of thanks   milton   she wrote one son   the house you built is too huge  i live in only one room  but i have to keep the whole house clean    gerald   she wrote to another   i am too old to travel  i

come into his office   what is your name   was the first thing\\nthe manager asked the new guy \\n\\n john   the new guy replied \\n\\nthe manager scowled   look  i don t know what kind of a place you\\nworked at before  but i don t call anyone by their first name  it\\nbreeds familiarity and that leads to a breakdown in authority  i\\nrefer to my employees by their last name only   smith  jones  baker\\n  that s all  i am to be referred to only as mr  robertson  now that\\nwe got that straight  what is your last name  \\n\\nthe new guy sighed and said   darling  my name is john darling  \\n\\n okay  john  the next thing i want to tell you is     as he was quietly watching television at home  the chap heard a sound on the roof of his house and rushed out to investigate  seeing it was a fair sized gorilla tearing the shingles off his home  he promptly called up the local zoo authorities to inform them one of their animals had escaped  he was reassured that a gorilla recovering units was on the way and to remain calm  a few minutes later  an old beat up truck  displaying the gorilla recovery unit logo on its panels  pulled up to the house  the elderly driver proceeds to recover from the back of the truck  a chihuahua dog  a pair of handcuffs  a ladder  a baseball bat  and a 12 gauge shotgun  puzzled on how this lone elderly was to solve the problem of this gorilla that had by now torn half the roof apart  the chap asked him how he would go about doing this  as he handed him over the 12 gauge shotgun  the zoo employee explained the plan   first i ll climb up there with the ladder  then i ll approach the gorilla and knock him off the roof using the baseball bat  as soon as the gorilla hits the ground  the specially trained chihuahua will attack its private parts  when i get back on the ground  the gorilla will have lowered its hands to its groin area to protect itself thus making it easy for me to slip on the handcuffs  then  i lead him to the truck  lock him up and take him back to the zoo     amazed at the procedure  the somewhat startled house owner asked why he was handed the 12 gauge shotgun   well   explained the experienced gorilla retriever   it s just a precaution should things not go exactly as planned  in the unlikely event that once on the roof  the gorilla knocks me off with the baseball  shoot the dog    hey  that shirt really looks becoming on you  then again  if i were that shirt  i d be coming too  one day long ago  there was a king who gathered all the people of the land  he said if anyone could swim across the lake  with crocodiles  would have their choice of   a castle  money  or his daughters hand in marriage \\none man jumped up and yelled  i can do it   he tried and failed  another man said  i can do better than that   so he jumped in and didn t make it either  next the crowd heard a splash  a man swam all the way across the lake  the king asked him  which one would you like  a castle  money  or my daughters  hand in marriage   the man replied  i want the idiot that pushed me in   once upon a time there was a priest and a nun that were traveling on a camel  on a desert  then in 3 months the camel dies  so the priest and the nun were stuck with each other alone  the priest find no other way to survive so he says   i m going to show you something that you never seen before   so he pulls out his thing and says  this is my tool of giving life   so the nun says  really then stick it in the camel so we can get the hell out of here  at duke university  there were four sophomores taking

finals  they decided to go up to the university of virginia and party with some friends there  they had a great time  but after all the hearty partying  they slept all day sunday and didn t make it back to duke until early monday morning  \\n\\nrather than taking the final then  they decided to find their professor after the final and explain to him why they missed it  they explained that they had gone to uva for the weekend with the plan to come back in time to study  but  unfortunately  they had a flat tire on the way back  didn t have a spare  and couldn t get help for a long time  as a result  they missed the final  \\n\\nthe professor thought it over and then agreed they could make up the final the following day  the guys were elated and relieved  they studied that night and went in the next day at the time the professor had told them  he placed them in separate rooms and handed each of them a test booklet  and told them to begin  \\n\\nthey looked at the first problem  worth five points  it was something simple about free radical formation   cool   they thought at the same time  each one in his separate room   this is going to be easy   each finished the problem and then turned the page  \\n\\non the second page was written   for 95 points   which tire  four men were bragging about how smart their dogs are  the first man was an engineer  the second was an accountant  the third was a chemist  and the fourth man was a government worker  to show off  the engineer called to his dog   t square  do your stuff   t square trotted over to a desk  took out some paper and a pen and promptly drew a circle  a square  and a triangle  everyone agreed that was pretty smart  \\n\\nthe accountant said his dog could do better  and said   slide rule  do your stuff   slide rule went out into the kitchen and returned with a dozen cookies  he divided them into 4 equal piles of 3 cookies each  everyone agreed that was good  \\n\\nthe chemist said his dog could do better still  so he called his dog and said   measure  do your stuff   measure got up  walked over to the fridge  took out a quart of milk  got a 10 ounce glass from the cupboard and poured exactly 8 ounces without spilling a drop  everyone agreed that was great  \\n\\nthe government worker called to his dog and said   coffee break  do your stuff   coffee break jumped to his feet  ate the cookies  drank the milk  dumped on the paper  sexually assaulted the other three dogs  claimed he injured his back while doing so  filed a grievance for unsafe working conditions  put in for workers compensation and went home on sick leave  everyone agreed that was really typical  three doctors are in the duck blind and a bird flies overhead  the general practitioner looks at it and says   looks like a duck  flies

says   hmmmm   green wings  yellow bill  quacking sound   might be a duck   he raises his gun to shoot it  but the bird is long gone  a third bird flies over  the surgeon raises his gun and shoots almost without looking  brings the bird down  and turns to the pathologist and says   go see if that was a duck    sir arthur conan doyle  the creator of the world famous detective  sherlock holmes  was not above telling tales about himself in which he was the laughing stock  here is one of those stories  as he tells it  he was waiting at a taxi  stand outside the railway station in paris  when a taxi pulled up he put his suitcase in it and got in himself  as he was about to tell the taxi driver where he wanted to go  the driver asked him   where can i take you  mr  doyle   doyle was flabbergasted  he asked the driver whether he knew him by sight  the driver said   no sir  i have never seen you before    the puzzled doyle asked him what made him think that he was conan doyle  the driver replied   this morning s paper had a story about you being on vacation in marseilles  this is the taxi stand where people who return from marseilles always come to  your skin colour tells me you have been on vacation  the ink spot on your right index finger suggests to me that you are a writer  your clothing is very english  and not french  adding up all those pieces of information  i deduce that you are sir arthur conan doyle   doyle said   this is truly amazing  you are a real life counter part to my fictional creation  sherlock holmes    there is one other thing   the driver said   what is that    your name is on the front of your suitcase    while escaped  a convict broke into a house and tied up a young couple who had been sleeping in the bedroom  as soon as he had a chance  the husband turned to his voluptuous young wife  bound up on the bed in a skimpy nightgown  and whispered   honey  this guy hasn t seen a woman in years  just cooperate with anything he wants

president clinton and representative condit had brought about the need for an eleventh commandment      they worked long and hard in a brain storming session to try to settle on the wording of the new

birds chirping  babbling brook  and a gentle breeze rustling the leaves while snapping shots  the athiest heard a noise behind him  and whirled around to see a huge bear coming through the bushes   he dropped his camera and ran  and kept running        and looking behind him  he noticed the bear was gaining on him   he was so scared that tears came to his eyes   he ran faster  but the bear was closing in on him   he ran faster yet  and tripped over a root   rolling over onto his back  the athiest saw the bear rise to his full height and raise a huge paw       and the athiest cried out   oh  god  no  and everything stopped   the birds stopped chirping   the brook stopped babbling   the gentle breeze stopped   and the bear froze with his paw in the air   and the athiest heard a booming voice say   young man   for years you doubted my very existance  but now that your life is in peril you call my name to help you   why should i do so  and the athiest thought for a moment  and said   yes  you are right   if you are god  then it would be hypocritical of me to become a christian at this point in my life   but  do you think that you could at least make the bear a christian for today    and the booming voice was quiet for a moment and then said   done  and everything started again   the birds chirping  brook babbling  and gentle breeze rustling the leaves   and the bear slowly lowered his paw and the bear put his paws together  and bowed his massive head and said   dear lord  please bless this food we are about to eat   a magician was working on a cruise ship in the

louder knock follows    aren t you going to answer that   says his wife   so he drags himself out of bed and goes downstairs   he opens the door and there is a man standing on the porch   it didn t take the homeowner long to realize the man was drunk  hi there   slurs the stranger    can you give me a push    no  get lost   it s half past three   i was in bed   says the man and he slams the door   he goes back up to bed and tells his wife what happened and she says   that wasn t very nice of you   remember that night we broke down in the pouring rain on the way to pick the kids up from the babysitter and you had to knock on that man s house to get us started again   what would have happened if he d told us to get lost   but the guy was drunk   says the husband    it doesn t matter   says the wife    he needs our help and it would be the christian thing to help him  so the husband gets out of bed again  gets dressed  and goes downstairs   he opens the front door  and not being able to see the stranger anywhere he shouts   hey  do you still want a push    and he hears a voice cry out   yeah  please    so  still being unable to see the stranger he shouts   where are you   and

looking around  they observed the other waiters and busboys each had a similar spoon  so the husband says   what s with the spoon  the waiter said  well  we had this company come in and evaluate our time management and they found that people drop their spoon 74 8  more often than any other utensil   so if we carry one with us  we can reduce the trips back to the kitchen by 3 hours per shift the husband was impressed   sure enough  he dropped his spoon during dinner and the waiter replaced it with his  stating   i ll just get another when i go to the kitchen for something else    while ordering dessert  the husband noted that the waiter had a very thin string hanging from the fly of his pants  as did the other waiters  so the husband asks    hey  there s a string on your pants    the waiter tells him    not all my customers are as observant as you    the same company found that we can reduce the amount of time spent in the bathroom by 2 hours each shift if we tie a string around the end of you know what  and when we have to go we just unzip and pull it out with the string completely eliminating the need to wash up and saving time    the husband was impressed  but asked    it s a good idea but how do you get it back in your pants     the waiter leaned close and whispered    well i don t know about the rest of them  but personally i use the spoon   there were these

shone his flashlight around  looking for valuables  and when he picked up a cd player to place in his sack  a strange  disembodied voice echoed from the dark saying  jesus is watching you   he nearly jumped out of his skin  clicked his flashlight out and froze  when he heard nothing more after a bit  he shook his head  clicked the light back on and began searching for more valuables  just as he pulled the stereo out so he could disconnect the wires  clear as a bell he heard   jesus is watching you   freaked out  he shone his light around  looking for the source of the voice  finally  in the corner of the room  his flashlight beam came to rest on a parrot   did you say that   he hissed at the parrot   yep   the parrot confessed   i m just trying to warn you   the burglar relaxed   warn me  huh  who the hell are you    moses   replied the bird   moses  the burglar laughed   what kind of stupid people would name a parrot moses    probably the same kind of people that would name a rotweiller jesus   the bird answered  when nuns are admitted to heaven they go through a special gate and are expected to make one last confession before they become angels \\nseveral nuns are lined up at this gate waiting to be absolved of their last sins before they are made holy \\n and so   says st  peter   have you ever had any contact with a man s member  \\n well   says the first nun in line   i did once just touch the tip of one with the tip of my finger  \\n ok  says st  peter   dip your finger in the holy water and pass on into heaven  \\nthe next nun admits that  well  yes  i did once get carried away and i  you know  sort of massaged one a bit  \\n ok  says st  peter   rinse your hand in the holy water and pass on into heaven  \\nsuddenly there is some jostling in the line and one of the nuns is trying to cut in front \\n well now  what s going on here   says st  peter \\n well  your excellency   says the nun who is trying to improve her position in line   if i m going to have to gargle that stuff  i want to do it before sister mary thomas sticks her rear in it   a man was wandering in the woods  pondering all  the mysteries of life and his own personal problems  the man couldn t find the answers  so he sought help from god  god  you there  god   he asked yes  what is it  my son   god answered  mind if i ask a few questions   the man asked  go ahead  my son  anything   god  what is a million years to you  god answered   a million years to me is only a second  the man asked   god  what is a million dollars worth to you  god replied   a million dollars to me is worth only a penny  the man lifted his eyebrows and asked his final  question   god  can i have a penny  god answered   sure  give me a second   the head of the monastery wanted to check how strong his priests are in resisting temptetion \\n\\nhe called 3 of them to his room  and ordered them to put a small bell on their member \\n\\nafter that  he went to the first guy  and showed him a picture of a gorgeous naked girl \\n\\n gling gling   went the bell  and the head of the monastary was furious   you call yourself a monk  you are as weak as a baby   \\n\\nhe went then to the second guy  and showed him a cover of a dirty porn movie \\n\\n gling gling   went the bell \\n\\n you are a disgrace  get out of my sight   \\n\\nalmost in complete dispair  he went to the thirs guy and showed him a cover of a porn magazine  there was silent \\n\\n way to go  son  you are the only man here worth to be call a monk   the head of the monastery said  while putting his hand on him \\n\\n gling gling   went the bell  the pope had just finished a tour of the east coast and wastaking a limousine to the airport  having never driven a limo  he asked the chauffeur if hecould drive for awhile  well  the chauffeur didn thave much of a choice  so the chauffeur climbs in the backof the limo and the pope takes the wheel  the pope proceeds to hop on 95 and starts accelerating to see whatthe limo could do  well he gets to about 90 mph and  wham    there arethe blue lights of our friendly state patrol in his mirror  he pulls over and the trooper comes to his window  well thetrooper  seeing who it was  says  just a moment please i needto call in   the trooper radio s in and asks for the chief  he tells the chief i ve got a really important person pulled over and i needto know what to do   the chief replys  who is it  not ted again    the trooper says   no  even more important   the chief replys   it s the governor  is it    the trooper replys  no  even more important    it s isn tthe president is it     no  more important   replys the trooper   well who the heck is it     screams the chief   i don t know   says the trooper   but he s got the pope as a chauffeur   a guy dies and goes to heaven  it s a slow day for st  peter  so  upon passing the entrance test  st  peter says   i m not very busy  today  why don t you let me show you around  the guy thinks this is a great idea and graciously accepts the offer  st  peter shows him all the sights  the golf course  the reading room and library  the observation room  the cafeteria and finally  they come to a huge room full of clocks the guy asks   what s up with these clocks  st  peter explains   everyone on earth has a clock that shows how much time he has left on earth  when a clock runs out of time  the person dies and comes to the gates to be judged  the guy thinks this makes sense but notices that some of the clocks are going faster than others  he asks why is that st  peter explains   every time a living person tells a lie  it speeds his clock  this also makes sense  so the guy takes one last look around the room before leaving and notices one clock in the center of the ceiling  on this clock  both hands are spinning at an unbelievable rate  so he asks   what s the story with that clock   oh  that   st  peter replies   that s oj simpson s clock  we decided to use it as a fan  an old preacher was dying  he sent a message for his irs agent and his lawyer  both church members   to come to his home  when they arrived  they were ushered up to his bedroom  as they entered the room  the preacher held out his hands and motioned for them to sit on each side of the bed  the preacher grasped their hands  sighed contentedly  smiled and stared at the ceiling  for a time  no one said anything  both the irs agent and lawyer were touched and flattered that the old preacher would ask them to be with him during his final moment they were also puzzled because the preacher had never given any indication that he particularly liked either one of them finally  the lawyer asked   preacher  why did you ask the two of us to come  the old preacher mustered up some strength  then said weakly   jesus died between two thieves  and that s how i want to go  too   there was a priest who decided to enter a monastery  this monastery had strict vows of silence  on his first day  the head abbot told him he could only speak two words every ten years at the end of his first ten years  the head abbot told him he could speak his first two words   bed hard   he said  the abbot recorded this in a book at the end of his second ten years  he was told he could speak his next two words   food bad   he said  the abbot recorded this in the book as well at the end of the third ten years  he was allowed to speak his next two words   i quit   he stated  well that doesn t surprise me   said the abbot  the record shows you ve done nothing by complain for the past thirty years   about a century or two ago  the pope challenged the jewish community of rome to a debate \\n\\nthe jews looked around for a champion who could defend their faith  but no one wanted to volunteer  it was too risky  so they finally picked an old man named moishe who spent his life sweeping up after people to represent them  being old and poor  he had less to lose  so he agreed  he asked only for one addition to the rules of debate  not being used to saying very much  he asked that neither side be allowed to talk  the pope agreed \\n\\nthe day of the great debate came  moishe and the pope sat opposite each other for a full minute before the pope raised his hand and showed three fingers  moishe looked back at him and raised one finger  the pope waved his fingers in a circle around his head  moishe pointed to the ground where he sat  the pope pulled out a wafer and a glass of wine  moishe pulled out an apple  the pope stood up and said   i give up  this man is too good  the jews win  \\n\\nan hour later  the cardinals were all around the pope asking him what happened  the pope said   first i held up three fingers to represent the trinity  he responded by holding up one finger  to remind me that there was still one god common to both our religions  then i waved my finger around me to show him  that god was all around us  he responded by pointing to the ground  showing that god was also right here with us  i pulled out the wine and the wafer to show that god absolves us from our sins  he pulled out an apple to remind me of original sin  he had an answer for everything  what could i do  \\n\\nmeanwhile  the jewish community had crowded around moishe  amazed that this old  almost feeble minded man had done what all their scholars had insisted was impossible   what happened   they asked \\n\\n well   said moishe   first he said to me that the jews had three days to get out of here  i told him that not one of us was leaving  then he told me that this whole city would be cleared of jews  i let him know that we were staying right here  \\n\\n and then   asked a woman \\n\\n i don t know   said moishe   he took out his lunch and i took out mine   an engineer died and ended up in hell  he was not pleased with the level of comfort in hell  and began to redesign and build improvements  after a while  they had toilets that flush  air conditioning  and escalators  everyone grew very fond of him  \\none day god called to satan to mock him   so  how s it going down there in hell   \\n\\nsatan replied   hey  things are great  we ve got air conditioning and flush toilets and escalators  and there s no telling what this engineer is going to come up with next  \\n\\ngod was surprised   what  you ve got an engineer  that s a mistake  he should never have gotten down there in the first place  send him back up here   \\n\\n no way   replied satan   i like having an engineer  and i m keeping him   \\n\\ngod threatened   send him back up here now or i ll sue   \\n\\nsatan laughed and answered   yeah  right  and just where are you going to get a lawyer   god was tired and worn out  so he spoke to st  peter  \\n\\n you know  i need a vacation  got any suggestions where i should go   \\n\\nst  peter  thinking  nodded his head  then said   how about jupiter  it s nice and warm there this time of the year   \\n\\ngod shook his head before saying   no  too much gravity  you know how that hurts my back   \\n\\n hmmm   st  peter reflected   well  how about mercury   \\n\\n no way   god muttered   it s way too hot for me there   \\n\\n i ve got it   st  peter said  his face lighting up   how about going down to earth for your vacation  \\n\\nchuckling  god remarked   are you kidding  two thousand years ago i went there  had an affair with some nice jewish girl  and they re still talking about it   bholaji finds himself in dire trouble  his business has gone bust and he s in serious financial trouble  he s so desperate that he decides to ask bhagwan for help  he goes into the temple and begins to pray “oh bhagwan  please help me  i ve lost my business and if i don t get some money  i m going to lose my house as well  please let me win the lottery ” lotto night comes and somebody else wins it  bholaji goes back to the temple   bhagwan please let me win the lotto  i ve lost my business  my house and i m going to lose my car as well ” lotto night comes and bholaji still has no luck  back to the temple he goes   my bhagwan  why have you forsaken me  i ve lost my business  my house  my car and my wife and children are starving  i don t often ask you for help and i have always been a good servant to you  why won t you just let me win the lotto this one time so i can get my life back in order  suddenly there is a blinding flash of light as the sky parts open and bholaji is confronted by the voice of god   bholaji  buy a damn lottery ticket first   after a few days  the lord called to adam and said   it is time for you and eve to begin the process of populating the earth  so i want you to kiss her   adam answered   yes  lord  but what is a  kiss    the lord gave a brief description to adam  who then took eve by the hand and led her to a nearby bush  a few minutes later  adam emerged and said   thank you  lord  that was enjoyable   and the lord replied   yes  adam  i thought you might enjoy that  now i d like you to caress eve   and adam said   what is a  caress    so the lord again gave adam a brief description and adam went behind the bush with eve  quite a few minutes later  adam returned  smiling  and said   lord  that was even better than the kiss   and the lord said   you ve done well  adam  now i want you to make love to eve   and adam asked   what is  make love  lord   so the lord again gave adam directions and adam went again to eve behind the bush  but this time he reappeared in two seconds  and adam said   lord  what is a  headache    one day jesus was out for a walk  strolling near the walls surrounding heaven  when he heard an old man s voice call from the other side \\n\\n hello  hello  \\n\\njesus replied   who is it  \\n\\n just a poor  old carpenter searching for his son   the old man replied

said  and the man in the rowboat rowed away  the waters rose to the edge of the roof and still the man sat on the roof until another rowboat came by and another man told him to get in   no thank you  the lord will save me   he said again  and the man rowed away  the waters covered the house and the man was forced to sit on his chimney as the rain poured down and a helicopter came by and another

house  he rang the doorbell and when no one answered  broke the lock on the kitchen door and went in it was pitch black inside as he made his way through the kitchen  then the dining room and into the den where he expected to find the things he wanted to steal   i see you and jesus sees you   a voice said  the burglar froze in his tracks  i see you and jesus sees you   the voice said again when nothing more happened  the burglar took out his flashlight and shined it in the direction of the voice  all he saw was a parrot on its perch  i see you and jesus sees you  the burglar laughed   just a

abstain from sex for the two weeks   the middle aged man replied   the first week was not too bad  the second week i had to sleep on the couch for a couple of nights  but  yep  we made it    congratulations  welcome to the church   said the priest the priest then went to the newlywed couple and asked   well  were you able to abstain from sex for two weeks    no pastor  we were not able to go without sex for the two weeks   the young man replied sadly  what happened   inquired the priest  my wife was reaching for a can of corn on the top shelf and dropped it   said the young man   when she bent over to pick it up  i was overcome with lust and took advantage of her right there   you understand  of course  this means you will not be welcome in our church   stated the priest   we know

committed adultery  the congregation was observant in thepriest s actions because he said if they couldn t do better than this hewould leave the church  the congregation liked the minister  so they came upwith a code word for every time they had committed adultery   they would gointo confession and say that they had  fallen  that week a couple of years later  that priest had died and was replaced  it came timefor the new priest to do confessions and he noticed that many of his memberswere coming in  saying they had  fallen   the new priest was concerned abouthis congregation and took it upon himself to go to the courthouse and talkto the mayor the priest walks into the mayor s office and says   mr  mayor  you have todo something about your sidewalks and walkways in the community  the mayor looking puzzled asks   sidewalks   the priest says   yeah  many of your citizens have fallen this week  the mayor realizes what the priest is talking about and says   there s noneed to be concerned father  don t worry about it and go home  the priest replied   no need to worry about it   i think if anyone should beworried it should be you  even your wife has fallen 3 times this week   there once was a 94 year old nun in the 1890 s whose worn out body began to surrender  her doctor prescribed for her a shot of whiskey three times a day  to relax her however  not to be lured into worldly pleasures  she huffily declined  but her mother superior knew the elderly sister loved milk  so she instructed the kitchen to spike the milk three times a day eventually  the elderly pious one approached her final hour  as several sisters gathered around her at bedside  the mother superior asked if she wanted to leave them any words of wisdom  oh  yes   she replied   never sell that cow   one beautiful morning a athiest was walking through the forest  admiring natures surroundings   he looked up and saw the trees swaying in the wind high above him and smiled   he saw the river glisten in the sun twinkle like a new born star and it made him warm inside   he thought to himself that mother nature had made a true and wonderful world   the athiest had walked a little further down the track he had taken when suddenly a bear jumped out of the bushes only a few yards ahead of him and started growling  looking hungry and ran quickly towards him   seeing the big bear bounding towards him he screamed in horror and started running as fast as he could away from the bear   knowing that the bear would catch up to him and he had no chance  the athiest soon ran out of breath and in a few paces fell to the ground    as the bears shadow fell upon his face and his paws come down upon his chest  the athiest screamed  oh help me god suddenly the trees that he so much admired stopped swaying   the river he loved suddenly stopped flowing  and the sky opened up and a voice begun to speak   i am god  and even though you dont believe in me  i am here for every being on this earth the athiest felt relieved a little bit and asked god    im sort of in this situation  im only asking if you can help me get out of it god thought for a moment and said    i will give you one wish to help you and that is all  you may proceed with this wish the athiest thought about this wish for a moment and then spoke to god    well i dont really want to become a christian  so i wish the bear to become a christian god spoke    so be it done suddenly the sky closed up   the river turned back into its flowing glory   the trees began to sway again   and the bear clapped his paws together and said    thankyou god for this meal im about to recieve  three preachers and their wives were killed in a car accident  upon their arrival at the pearly gates  they were met by st  peter the first preacher walked up and said  hello st  peter  i m ready to come in  st  peter checked his list and said  i m sorry your name is not in the book   what   exclaimed the preacher   i have been a preacher

walked away the next preacher came up to the st  feeling pretty certain he would be allowed in   i m ready to come in st  peter  he said with a smile  i m sorry  your name is not in the book     how can that be   asked the preacher   i have been a pastor for 20 years    you are guilty of the sin of greed  you loved money so much  you married a woman named penny    defeated  the preacher took his wifes hand and walked away   the last preacher  certain of the out come  turned to his wife and said   come on fanny  i m not gettin  in   jesus is crucified  hanging on the cross up on a hill  below the hill there is a crowd of onlookers  including st  peter   peter  peter  i need to tell you something  jesus cries  so peter  devoted to his lord  breaks from the crowd towards the hill only to be stopped by a group of roman soldiers  beat up and thrown back down  peter  please  i need to tell you something   jesus cries again  full of faith and love for christ  he runs up the hill and almost gets past the soldiers  but  he s caught  beat up again and tossed back into the crowd  finally  jesus screams  peter  i must tell you something  please  come to me  peter  sorrowed by his lord s suffering  runs up the hill bloody and bruised and finally makes it past the soldiers  he kneels in front of jesus   here i am my lord  your faithful servant  what is it that you need to tell me

up with technology like the computer industry has  we would all be driving cars that cost  25 00 and get 1 00 miles to the gallon  \\n\\nin response to bills comment  general motors issued a press release making the following statement   if we  gm  had kept up with technology like the computer industry has  we would all be driving cars with the following characteristics \\n\\n1  for no reson whatsoever  your car would crash twice per day \\n2  every time they repainted the lines in the road  you would have to buy a new car \\n3  your car would occasionally stop on the freeway without reason  in order to get started again  you would have to pull off to the side of the road  close all the windowsshut off the car resart it and open all the windows again  for some unknown reason  you would simply do this without question \\n4  occasionally  executing a maneuver  such as a left turn  would cause your car to shut down and refuse to resart  in which case you would have to reinstall the engine \\n5  only one person could use the car at one time unless you bought  car95  or  carnt   but then you would also have to buy more seats \\n6  the new seats you would need would force everyone to have the same size butt \\n7  you would press the  start  button to shut off the engine \\n8  the oil warning light  water warning light  and alternator warning light would all be replaced by a single  unidentified system error  light \\n9  the air bag would ask ur freshly mangled body  are you sure  before going off \\n10  occasionally  for no reason whatsoever  your car would lock you out and refuse to let you back inuntill you simultaneously lifted the driver side door handle  turned the key  and grabbed the radio antenna \\n11  the radio antenna would be internally mounted on the passenger side of the car \\n12  buying a new car would force you to also purchase a new set of deluxe rand mcnally road maps  dispite the fact that you niether need nor want them  attempting to delet this otion would immediately cause your cars performance to diminish by 50  or more \\n13  every time gm introduced a new car  people would have to learn to drive all over again because none of the old controls would function in the new car \\n14  macintosh would make a car that was five times faster  ten times more reliable and easier to mantain  twice as easy to drive  but would only run on five percent of the roads   reaching the end of a job interview  the human resources person asked a young engineer fresh out of mit   and what starting salary were you looking for  the engineer said

\\nbut when it happens they wish they were dead  this memo is to announce the development of a new software system which will be year 2000 compliant  this program is known as  millennia year application software system   myass   \\nnext monday there will be a meeting in which i will show myass to everyone  we will hold demonstrations throughout the month so that all employees will have an opportunity to get a good look at myass  we have not addressed networking aspects yet  so currently only one person at a time can use myass  this restriction will be removed after myass expands  \\n\\nsome employees have begun using the program already  this morning i walked into a subordinate s office and was not surprised to find that he had his nose buried in myass  some of the less technical people may be somewhat afraid of myass  last week my secretary said to me   i m a little nervous  i never put anything in myass before   i helped her through the first time and afterward she admitted that it was relatively painless and she was actually looking forward to doing it again  and was even ready to kiss myass  \\n\\nthere have been concerns over the virus that was found in myass upon initial installation  but the virus has been eliminated and we were able to save myass  in the future  however  protection will be required prior to entering myass  this database will encompass all information associated with the business  \\n\\nas you begin using the program  feel free to put anything you want in myass  as myass grows larger  we envision a time when it will be commonplace for a supervisor to hand work to an employee and say   here  stick this in myass   it will be a great day when we need data quickly and our employees can respond   here it is  i just pulled it out of myass   recently a teacher  a garbage collector  and a lawyer wound up together at the pearly gates  st  peter informed them that in order to get into heaven  they would each have to answer one question  st  peter addressed the teacher and asked   what was the name of the ship that crashed into the iceberg  they just made a movie about it   the teacher answered quickly   that would be the titanic   st  peter let him through the gate  st  peter turned to the garbage man and  figuring heaven didn t really need all the odors that this guy would bring with him  decided to make the question a little harder   how many people died on the ship   fortunately for him  the trash man had just seen the movie and answered   about 1 500    that s right  you may enter   st  peter then turned to the lawyer   name them   a big city california lawyer went duck hunting in rural texas  he shot and dropped a bird  but it fell into a farmer s field on the other side of a fence  as the lawyer climbed over the fence  an elderly farmer drove up on his tractor and asked him what he was doing  the litigator responded   i shot a duck and it fell into this field  and now i m going to retrieve it   the old farmer replied   this is my property  and you are not coming over here   the indignant lawyer said   i am one of the best trial attorneys in the u s  and  if you don t let me get that duck  i ll sue you and take everything you own   the old farmer smiled and said   apparently  you don t know how we do things in texas  we settle small disagreements like this with the texas three kick rule   the lawyer asked  what is the texas three kick rule    the farmer replied   well  first i kick you three times and then you kick me three times  and so on  back and forth  until someone gives up   the attorney quickly thought about the proposed contest and decided that he could easily take the old codger  he agreed to abide by the local custom  the old farmer slowly climbed down from the tractor and walked up to the city feller  his first kick planted the toe of his heavy work boot into the lawyer s groin and dropped him to his knees  his second kick nearly wiped the man s nose off his face  the barrister was flat on this belly when the farmer s third kick to a kidney nearly caused him to give up  the lawyer summoned every bit of his will and managed to get to his feet and said   ok  you old coot  now  it s my turn   the old farmer smiled and said   no i give up  you can have the duck  a local united way office realized that the organization had never received a donation from the town s most successful lawyer  the person in charge of contributions called him to persuade him to contribute  our research shows that out of a yearly income of at least  500 000  you give not a penny to charity  wouldn t you like to give back to the community in some way  the lawyer mulled this over for a moment and replied   first  did your research also show that my mother is dying after a long illness  and has medical bills that are several times her annual income  embarrassed  the united way rep mumbled   um     no  the lawyer interrupts   or that my brother  a disabled veteran  is blind and confined to a wheelchair  the stricken united way rep began to stammer out an apology  but was interrupted again  or that my sister s husband died in a traffic accident   the lawyer s voice rising in indignation   leaving her penniless with three children   the humiliated united way rep  completely beaten  said simply   i had no idea    on a roll  the lawyer cut him off once again   so if i don t give any money to them  why should i give any to you   one day a lawyer was riding in his limosine when he saw a guy eating grass  he told the driver to stop  he got out and asked him   why are you eating grass  the man replied   i m so poor  i can t afford anything thing to eat  so the layer said   poor guy  come back to my house  the guys says   but i have a wife and three kids   the lawyer told him to bring them along when they were all in the car  the poor man said   thanks for taking us back to your house  it is so kind of you  the lawyer replied   you re going to love it there    the

the puzzled groom   how can that be if you ve been married ten times    well  husband  1 was a sales representative  he kept telling me how great it was going to be  husband  2 was in software services  he was never really sure how it was supposed to function  but he said he d look into it and get back to me  husband  3 was from field services  he said everything checked out diagnostically but he just couldn t get the system up  husband  4 was in telemarketing  even though he knew he had the order  he didn t know when he would be able to deliver  husband  5 was an engineer  he

  said the new husband   but  why    you re a lawyer  this time i know i m gonna get screwed   one afternoon  a wealthy lawyer was riding in the back of his limousine when he saw two men eating grass by the road side  he ordered his driver to stop and he got out to investigate  he asked one of the men  why are you eating the grass    we don t have money for food   the poor man replied  oh  come along with me then   instructed the lawyer the man answered  but sir  i have a wife and two children  bring them along  replied the lawyer  the lawyer turn to the other man and said   come with us   but sir  i have a wife and six children   the second man answered  bring them as well   replied the lawyer as he headed for his limo  they all climbed into the limo once underway  one of the poor fellows says  sir  you are too kind  thank you for taking all of us with you  the lawyer replied   no problem  the grass at my house is almost a foot tall   a trial had been scheduled in a small town  but the court clerk had forgotten to call in a jury panel  rather than adjourning what he thought was an exceptionally simple case  the judge ordered his bailiff to go through the courthouse and round up enough people to form a jury  the bailiff returned with a group of lawyers the prosecutor felt that it would be an interesting experiment to try a case before a jury of lawyers  and the defense counsel had no objection  so a jury was impaneled  and the trial went very quickly    after only an hour of testimony  and very short closing arguments  both sides rested  the jury was then instructed by the judge  and was sent back to the jury room to deliberate after nearly six hours  the trial court was concerned that the jury had not returned with a verdict  the case had in fact turned out to be every bit as simple as he had expected  and it seemed to him that they should have been back in minutes  he sent the bailiff to the jury room  to see if they needed anything the bailiff returned  and the judge asked   are they close to reaching a verdict   the bailiff shook his head  and replied   you re honor  they re still doing nomination speeches for the position of foreman   a lawyer was on his deathbed in his bedroom  and he called to his wife  she rushed in and said   what is it  honey  he told her to run and get the bible as soon as possible  being a religious woman  she thought this was a good idea  she ran and got it  prepared to read him his favorite verse or something of the sort  he snatched it from her and began quickly scanning pages  his eyes darting right and left  the wife was curious  so she asked   what are you doing  honey   i m looking for loopholes   he shouted  three paramedics were boasting about improvements in their respective ambulance team s response times  since we installed our new satellite navigation system   bragged the first one   we cut our emergency response time by ten percent  the other paramedics nodded in approval   not bad   the second paramedic commented   but by using a computer model of traffic patterns  we ve cut our average ert by 20 percent  again  the other team members gave their congratulations  until the third paramedic said   that s nothing  since our ambulance driver passed the bar exam  we ve cut our emergency response time in half   an attorney telephoned the governor just after midnite  insisting that he talk to him regarding a matter of utmost urgency an aide eventually agreed to wake up the governor   so  what is it   grumbled the governor   judge garber has just died  said the attorney   and i want to take his place   replied the governor   well  it s ok with me if it s ok with the undertaker   an investment counselor went out on her own  she was shrewd and diligent  so business kept coming in  and pretty soon she realized she needed an in house counsel  so she began interviewing young lawyers   as i m sure you can understand   she started off with one of the first applicants   in a business like this  our personal integrity must be beyond question   she leaned forward   mr  peterson  are you an  honest  lawyer    honest   replied the job prospect   let me tell you something about honesty  why  i m so honest that my father lent me fifteen thousand dollars for my education and i paid back every penny the minute i tried my very first case    impressive      and what sort of case was that   the lawyer squirmed in his seat and admitted   he sued me for the money   a barber gave a haircut to a priest one day  the priest tried to pay for the haircut but the barber refused saying   i cannot accept money from you  for you are a good man   you do god s work   the next morning the barber found a dozen bibles at the door to his shop a policeman came to the barber for a haircut  and again the barber refused payment saying   i cannot accept money from you  for you are a good man   you protect the public   the next morning the barber found a dozen doughnuts at the door to his shop a lawyer came to the barber for a haircut  and again the barber refused payment saying   i cannot accept money from you  for you are a good man   you serve the justice system   the next morning the barber found a dozen more lawyers waiting for a haircut  a doctor and a lawyer were talking at a party  their conversation was constantly interrupted by people describing their ailments and asking the doctor for free medical advice  after an hour of this  the exasperated doctor asked the lawyer   what do you do to stop people from asking you for legal advice when you re out of the office   i give it to them   replied the lawyer   and then i send them a bill  the doctor was shocked  but agreed to give it a try  the next day  still feeling slightly guilty  the doctor prepared the bills  when he went to place them in his mailbox  he found a bill from the lawyer  at the united way in a fairly small town a volunteer worker noticed that the most successful lawyer in the whole town hadn t made a contribution  this guy was making about  600 000 a year so the volunteer thought   why not call him up  he calls up the lawyer  sir  according to our research you haven t made a contribution to the united way  would you like to do so  the lawyer responds   a contribution  does your research show that i have an invalid mother who requires expensive surgery once a year just to stay alive  the worker is feeling a bit embarrassed and says   well  no sir  i m     does your research show that my sister s husband was killed in a car accident  she has three kids and no means of support  the worker is feeling quite embarrassed at this point   i m terribly sorry     does your research show that my brother broke his neck on the job and now requires a full time nurse to have any kind of normal life  the worker is completely humiliated at this point   i am sorry sir  please forgive me     the gall of you people  i don t give them anything  so why should i give it to you   a

strong evidence indicating guilt  but no corpse had been found  in the defense s closing statement the lawyer  knowing that his client would probably be convicted  decided to try a trick   ladies and gentlemen of the jury  i have a surprise for you all   the lawyer said as he looked at his watch   within one minute  the person presumed dead in this case will walk into this courtroom   he looked toward the courtroom door  the jurors  somewhat stunned  all looked  eagerly  a minute passed  nothing happened  finally  the lawyer said   actually  i made up the previous statement  but you all looked on with anticipation  i therefore put it to you that there is reasonable doubt in this case as to whether anyone was killed and insist that you return a verdict of not guilty   with that  the jury retired to deliberate  but after only a few minutes  they came back and pronounced a verdict of guilty   but how   the lawyer asked   you must have had some doubt  i saw all of you stare at the door    oh  yes   the jury foreman replied   we all looked   but your client didn t   an airliner was having engine trouble  and the pilot instructed the cabin crew to have the passengers take their seats and get prepared for an emergency landing  a few minutes later  the pilot asked the flight attendants if everyone was buckled in and ready   all set back here  captain   came the reply   except one lawyer who is still going around passing out business cards   an engineer dies and reports to the pearly gates  st  peter checks his dossier and says   ah  you re an engineer    you re in the wrong place  so  the engineer reports to the gates of hell and is let in  pretty soon  the engineer gets dissatisfied with the level of comfort in hell  and starts designing and building improvements  after awhile  they ve got air conditioning and flush toilets and escalators  and the engineer is a pretty popular guy one day  god calls satan up on the telephone and says with a sneer   so  how s it going down there in hell  satan replies   hey  things are going great    we ve got air conditioning and flush toilets and escalators  and there s no telling what this engineer is going to come up with next  god replies   what    you ve got an engineer  that s a mistake    he should never have gotten down there  send him up here   satan says   no way   i like having an engineer on the staff  and i m keeping him   god says   send him back up here or i ll sue  satan laughs uproariously and answers   yeah  right  and just where are you going to get a lawyer   a lawyer s dog runs around town unleashed  heads for a butcher shop and steals a roast  the butcher goes to the lawyer s office and asks   if a dog running unleashed steals a piece of meat from my store  do i have a right to demand payment for the meat from the dog s owner   the lawyer answers   definitely   then you owe me  8 50  your dog was loose and stole a roast from me today  the lawyer  without a word  writes the butcher a check for  8 50  the butcher  having a feeling of satisfaction  leaves three days later  the butcher finds a bill from the lawyer   100 due for a consultation  at the height of a political corruption trial  the prosecuting attorney attacked a witness   isn t it true   he bellowed   that you accepted five thousand dollars to compromise this case  the witness stared out the window  as though he hadn t hear the question  isn t it true that you accepted five thousand dollars to compromise this case   the lawyer repeated loudly the witness still did not respond finally  the judge leaned over and said   sir  please answer the question   oh   the startled witness said   i thought he was talking to you   the devil visited a lawyer s office and made him an offer   i can arrange some things for you    the devil said   i ll increase your income five fold  your partners will love you  your clients will respect you  you ll have four months of vacation each year and live to be a hundred  all i require in return is that your wife s soul  your children s souls  and their children s souls rot in hell for eternity  the lawyer thought for a moment and asked   what s the catch    a guy walks into a post office one day to see a middle aged  balding man standing at the counter methodically placing  love  stamps on bright pink envelopes with hearts all over them  he then takes out a perfume bottle and starts spraying scent all over them his curiosity getting the better of him  he goes up to the balding man and asks him what he is doing  the man says   i m sending out 1 000 valentine cards signed   guess who    but why   asks the man  i m a divorce lawyer   the man replies  nasa was interviewing professionals to be sent to mars  only one could go and couldn’t return to earth the first applicant  an engineer  was asked how much he wanted to be paid for going   a million dollars   he answered   because i want to donate it to m i t  the next applicant  a doctor  was asked the same question  he asked for  2 million   i want to give a million to my family   he explained   and leave the other million for the advancement of medical research  the last applicant was a lawyer  when asked how much money he wanted  he whispered in the interviewer’s ear   three million dollars   why so much more than the others   asked the interviewer the lawyer replied   if you give me  3 million  i’ll give you  1 million  i’ll keep  1 million  and we’ll send the engineer to mars   a clever attorney was convinced he found a way to take all of his riches with him when he died   when he finally became ill and saw that death was imminent  he instructed his wife to sell all of his investments and buy gold coins with the proceeds   she was instructed to place the gold in several bags with handles and place them in the attic directly over his bedroom   his plan was that when he died  his soul would rise up out of his body and ascend to heaven   as he passed through the attic  he would grab the bags of gold and take them with him  days later he finally died and the next day his wife went to the attic to see if the gold was gone  but found it was all still there    the damn fool   she said to herself    i told him we should have placed the bags in the basement   moral   we re not going to be able to take it with us when we go   even if we re so clever as to place half our riches in the attic and half in the basement  they ll probably take us out the side door  a dying man gathered his lawyer  doctor and clergyman at his bed side and handed each of them an envelope containing  25 000 in cash  he made them each promise that after his death and during his repose  they would place the three envelopes in his coffin  he told them that he wanted to have enough money to enjoy the next life a week later the man died  at the wake  the lawyer and doctor and clergyman  each concealed an envelope in the coffin and bid their old client and friend farewell  by chance  these three met several months later  soon the clergyman  feeling guilty  blurted out a confession saying that there was only  10 000 in the envelope he placed in the coffin  he felt  rather than waste all the money  he would send it to a mission in south america  he asked for their forgiveness  the doctor  moved by the gentle clergymans sincerity  confessed that he too had kept some of the money for a worthy medical charity  the envelope  he admitted  had only  8000 in it  he said  he too could not bring himself to waste the money so frivolously when it could be used to benefit others by this time the lawyer was seething with self righteous outrage  he expressed his deep disappointment in the felonious behavior of two of his oldest and most trusted friends   i am the only one who kept his promise to our dying friend  i want you both to know that the envelope i placed in the coffin contained the full amount  indeed  my envelope contained my personal check for the entire  25 000   somebody from a local charity is going over some files and realizes he hasn t gotten any donations from the towns most succesful lawyer so the man calls the lawyer and says  our records show that you haven t made any donations to us   then the lawyer says  well  did your records show that my mom is sick with bills three times her annual income  or that my sister s husband died in an accident which leaved her penniless with three children  or that my brother is blind and has no money to pay for an aid or a nurse   ummmmm sorry  replied the man   i had no idea   then the lawyer says  so if i don t give any money to them why would i give any money to you   a man is at his lawyer s funeral and and is surprised by the turnout for this one man  he turns to the people around him   why are you all at this man s funeral   a man turns towards him and says   we re all clients    and you all came to pay your respects  how touching    no  we came to make sure he was dead   while two families were waiting in line to see the washington monument  their two five year old boys were getting acquainted   my name is joshua  what s yours   asked the first boy   adam   replied the second   my daddy is a doctor  what does your daddy do for a living   asked joshua adam proudly replied   my daddy is a lawyer   honest   asked joshua  no  just the regular kind   replied adam  three construction contractors were visiting a tourist attraction on\\nthe same day  one was from new york  another from texas  and the\\nthird from florida  at the end of the tour  the tour guide asked\\nthem what they did for a living \\n\\nwhen they all replied that they were construction contractors  the\\nguide said   hey  we need one of the rear fences redone  why don t\\nyou guys take a look at it and give me a bid   so  to the back fence\\nthey all went to check it out \\n\\nfirst to step up was the florida contractor  he took out his tape\\nmeasure and pencil  did some measuring and said   well i figure

figuring and said   looks like i can do this\\njob for  700   300 for materials   300 for my crew  and  100 profit\\nfor me  \\n\\nwithout so much as moving  the new york contractor said    2 700  \\n\\nthe guide  incredulous  looked at him and said   you didn t even\\nmeasure like the other guys  how did you come up with such a high\\nfigure  \\n\\n easy   he said    1 000 for me   1 000 for you and we hire the guy\\nfrom texas   a priest  a doctor  and a lawyer were waiting one morning on a particularly slow group of golfers  what s wrong with these guys   fumed the lawyer   we must have been waiting for 15 minutes   i don t know   said the doctor   but i ve never seen such ineptitude   here comes the greenskeeper   said the priest   let s have a word with him  say  george  what s with that group ahead of us  they re rather slow  aren t they   oh  yes   said george   that s the group of blind firefighters  they lost their sight while saving our club last year  we let them play here anytime free of charge  everyone was silent for a moment  then the priest said   that s so sad  i think i ll say a prayer for them tonight   and i m going to contact my ophthalmologist buddy and see if there is anything he can do for them   the doctor added  why can t these guys play at night   asked the lawyer  a lawyer and two friends  a rabbi  and a hindu holy man  had car trouble in the countryside and asked to spend the night with a farmer  the farmer said   there might be a problem  you see  i only have room for two to sleep in the house  so one of you must sleep in the barn    no problem   chimed the rabbi   my people wandered in the desert for forty years  i am humble enough to sleep in the barn for one evening   with that he departed to the barn  and the others bedded down for the night  moments later a knock was heard at the door  the farmer opened the door  there stood the rabbi from the barn   what s wrong   asked the farmer  he replied   i am grateful to you  but i just can t sleep in the barn  there is a pig in the barn  and my faith believes that is an unclean animal  his hindu friend agrees to swap places with him  but a few minutes later the same scene reoccurs  there is a knock on the door   what s wrong   the farmer asks  the hindu holy man replies   i  too  am grateful for your helping us out  but there is a cow in the barn  in my country cows are considered sacred and i can t sleep on holy ground   that left only the lawyer to make the change  he grumbled and complained  but went out to the barn  moments later there was another knock on the farmer s door  frustrated and tired  the farmer opens the door  and there stood the pig and the cow  an old penny pincher had no friends  just before he died he asked his doctor  lawyer  and pastor to gather around him at bedside  i have always heard that you can t take it with you  but i want to disprove that theory   he said   i have  90 000 under my mattress  and when i die  just before they throw the dirt on me at my burial  i want you each to toss in an envelope with  30 000 within  the three attended the funeral and each threw his envelope in the grave  on the way back from the cemetery  the pastor said   i must confess  i needed  10 000 for my new church  so i only threw in  20 000   the doctor then said   i must confess too  i needed  20 000 for a new hospital i was opening up  so i only threw in  10 000  the lawyer looked at them both and shook his head  he then said   gentlemen  i m surprised  shocked  and ashamed of you  i don t see how you could dare to go against that man s final wish  i mean  i threw in my personal check for the full amount…  one morning a blind bunny was hopping down the bunny trail  and he tripped over a large snake and fell  kerplop   right on his twitchy little nose   oh  please excuse me   said the bunny   i didn t mean to trip over you  but i m blind and can t see    that s perfectly all right   replied the snake   to be sure  it was my fault  i didn t mean to trip you  but i m blind too  and i didn t see you coming  by the way  what kind of animal are you   well  i really don t know   said the bunny   i m blind  and i ve never seen myself  maybe you could examine me and find out  so the snake felt the bunny all over  and he said   well  you re soft  and cuddly  and you have long silky ears  and a little fluffy tail and a dear twitchy little nose    you must be a bunny rabbit  then he said   i can t thank you enough  but by the way  what kind of animal are you  and the snake replied that he didn t know  and the bunny agreed to examine him  and when he was finished  the snake said   well  what kind of an animal am i  so the bunny felt the snake all over  and he replied   you re hard  you re cold

number 1 thing that sounds dirty in law but isn t  1   think you can get me off  a truck driver frequently traveled through a small town where there was a courthouse at the side of the road  of course  there were always lawyers walking along the road  the truck driver made it a practice to hit any pedestrian lawyers with his truck as he sped by  \\n\\none day  he spotted a priest walking along the road and stopped to give him a ride  a little further along  as he approached the town  he spotted a lawyer walking along the side of the road  \\n\\nautomatically  he veered his truck towards the lawyer  but   then he remembered his passenger  he swerved back to the center  but he heard a  whump  and in the rear view mirror he spotted the lawyer rolling across the field  \\n\\nhe turned to the priest and said   father  i m sure that i missed that lawyer   \\n\\nand the priest replied   that s ok  my son  i got him with the door   a man was sent to hell for his sins  as he was being taken to his place of eternal torment  he passed a room where a lawyer was having an intimate encounter with a beautiful young woman \\n\\n what a ripoff   the man muttered   i have to roast for all eternity  and that lawyer gets to spend it with a beautiful woman   \\n\\njabbing the man with his pitchfork  the escorting demon snarled   who are you to question that woman s punishment    daddy   a little girl asked her father   do all fairy tales begin with  once upon a time     no  sweetheart   he answered   some begin with  if i am elected    one day president bush was visiting queen elizabeth and she decided to take him for a tour of london in the royal carriage  the carriage was being pulled by six royal stallions and one of them suddenly passed gas  it sounded like a 21 gun salute it was so loud  the smell permeated the inside of the carriage and the queen was totally devastated  i appoligize profusely for the terrible smell inside the carriage   she said   oh  that s alright   said the george   for a minute there i thought it was the horse   einstein dies and goes to heaven  at the pearly gates  saint peter tells him   you look like einstein  but you have no idea the lengths that some people will go to sneak into heaven  can you prove who you really are   einstein ponders for a few seconds and asks   could i have a blackboard and some chalk   saint peter snaps his fingers and a blackboard and chalk instantly appear  einstein proceeds to describe with arcane mathematics and symbols his theory of relativity  saint peter is suitably impressed   you really are einstein   he says   welcome to heaven   the next to arrive is picasso  once again  saint peter asks for credentials  picasso asks   mind if i use that blackboard and chalk   saint peter says   go ahead   picasso erases einstein s equations and sketches a truly stunning mural with just a few strokes of chalk  saint peter claps   surely you are the great artist you claim to be   he says   come on in   then saint peter looks up and sees george w  bush  saint peter scratches his head and says   einstein and picasso both managed to prove their identity  how can you prove yours   george w  looks bewildered and says   who are einstein and picasso   saint peter sighs and says   come on in  george   clinton walks out into his garden one day and in the snow he says  bastard  written in piss  he is so outraged he goes into the oval office and calls the cia and fbi to tell them to find out who did this horrible thing to his garden  so they go out and investigate and when they return they say  well bill  we ve got bad news and we ve got worse news  which one would you like to hear first   and bill says   what s the bad news   the agent replies   it was al gore   aghast bill yells   that dirty no good son of a            what s the worse news   so the agent says   it was hillary s handwriting     one day the pope was in from italy and after a rough week of meeting arch bishops and other religious figures  he decided to go see the galveston shore in texas \\n\\nwhen he arrives in his popemobile he sees a man strugling for his life aginst a shark \\n\\nupon a closer look he notices that it is john kerry \\n\\nhorrified he starts to call for help when a speedboat pulls up along side mr kerry  with gw and dick cheney on board  dick checny leans over and pulls him out  then george w  and dick cheney begin to beat the shark to death with baseball bats \\n\\nthe two men notice the pope and land the boat on the beach \\n\\nthe pope said to the men \\n\\n i know that there has been alot of attention and alot of strife in this election  but i can see that you two men respect each other and would help each other in their house of need  you have my blessings \\n\\nthen the pope packs off and drives out of site \\n\\nbush asks   who was that  \\n\\n that was the pope mr president  he is all knowing and in touch with god  leader of the chatholic church  said dick \\n\\nbush says   well thats all neat and fine  but he dosent know anything about shark fishing  hows the bait holding up   the president and mrs  clinton are in the front row just above the dugout at a yankees game   the row behind them is taken up with secretservice agents  one of them leans over and whispers something in thepresident s ear president clinton pauses  then grabs hillary by the scruff of the neckand heaves her over the railing   she falls 10 feet to the top of thedug out  kicking and screaming obscenities all the way down  and aftershe lands  the president bows to the crowd  and shakes hands and  highfive s  everyone near him the same secret service agent again leans over and whispers   no mr president  i said  they want you to throw out the first pitch   the last four u s  presidents are caught in a tornado in kansas  and off they spin to the land of oz  after threatening trials and tribulations  they finally make it to the emerald city and come before the great wizard  what brings you before the great wizard  what do you want  jimmy carter steps forward timidly  i had a terrible time with iran  so i ve come for some courage   no problem  says the wizard   who is next  ronald reagan steps forward   well    well    well    i need a brain   done  says the wizard  who comes next before the great wizard  up steps george bush sadly   i m told by the american people that ineed a heart   i ve heard it s true  says the wizard   consider it done  then there is a great silence bill clinton is just standing there  looking around  but doesn t say a word irritated  the wizard finally asks   what brings you to the emerald city   and willie replies    is dorothy around   while walking down the street  dubya was struck by a large wheel of cheese that fell out of swissair flight 19 \\n sadly  george does not make it and his soul arrives in heaven and he is met by st  peter at the pearly gates \\n  welcome george     says st  peter    we seldom see republicans here  so we re not sure what to do     no problem pete  let me in i m worthy    says dubya  \\n  i d like to but i have orders from the man himself  he says you have to spend one day in hell then one day in heaven so you choose where you ll live for eternity     i ve made up my mind  i want to be in heaven    says dubya  \\n  i m sorry  but we have rules    so  st  peter escorted him to an elevator and he goes down  down  down  all the way to hell  \\n the doors open  and he finds himself in the middle of a country club  it s 72 degrees  no oil shortage here \\n there s a texas style barbecue with cloned cattle and genetically engineered corn  \\n standing in the crowd are other republicans who had helped him out \\nover the years \\n expensively dressed  jerry falwell  dick cheney and rush limbaugh  greet him  then they reminisce about getting rich at the expense of the poor and the liberals  \\n soon  the devil approaches bush  then says    have a milk shake and relax  dubya   dubya drinks the shake  and takes a liking to the devil  but it is now time to go \\n dubya got on the elevator then returns to heaven and st  peter says    now it s time to visit heaven    so for 24 hours bush hung out with a bunch of honest  good natured animal rights activists  people who enjoy talking of family values instead of money and power \\n  all these people are poor     dubya thought to himself   pat robertson never prepared me for this    st  peter returned  then said    so  you ve spent a day in hell and a day in heaven  now you must choose    the jeopardy theme plays softly as dubya reflects for a minute  then says    i belong in hell with my friends    so st  peter put him on the elevator and he went down  down  down all the way to hell  \\n the doors of the elevator open  and he finds himself in the middle of this barren  scorched earth  covered with \\nleaking 55 gallon drums of toxic industrial waste  kinda like gary  indiana  \\n horrified  dubya sees his friends dressed in rags  and picking up the industrial waste with teaspoons  \\n lucifer comes over to dubya then puts an arm around his shoulder and\\nsays    thank you     what happened      says dubya    yesterday i had a \\ntexas barbecue  we had a wonderful time  now there s a wasteland and everybody seems miserable    the devil smiled  and explained    see  yesterday i was campaigning   today i got your vote   last summer  the president and mrs  clinton were vacationing in their home state of arkansas  on a venture one day  they stopped at a service station to fill up the car with gas  it seemed that the owner of the station was once hillary s high school love they exchanged hellos  and went on their way as they were driving on to their destination  bill put his arm around hillary and said   well  honey  if you had stayed with him  you would be the wife of a service station owner today  she smirked and replied   no  if i had stayed with him  he would be president of the united states   john kerry visits a primary school and sits in on one of the classes  which is in the middle of a discussion of words and their meaning \\n\\nthe teacher asks mr  kerry if he would like to lead the discussion of the word  tragedy  \\n\\nso  the illustrious leader asks the class for an example of a  tragedy  \\n\\none little boy stands up and offers   if my best friend  who lives on a farm  is playing in the field and a runaway tractor comes along and knocks him dead  that would be a tragedy \\n\\n that s wrong   kerry says   that would be considered an accident  \\n\\na little girl raises her hand   if a school bus carrying 50 children drove over a cliff  killing everyone inside  that would be a tragedy  \\n\\n you are completely incorrect  says the senator   that would be what we \\nwould consider a great loss  \\n\\nthe room goes silent  no other children volunteer  kerry searches the room   isn t there someone here who can give me an example of a tragedy  \\n\\nfinally at the back of the room a small boy raises his hand  in a quiet voice he says   if a plane carrying senator john kerry was struck by a missile and blown to smithereens  that would be a tragedy  \\n\\n fantastic    exclaims kerry   you are absolutely right  can you tell me why that would be a tragedy  \\n\\n well   says the boy   because it sure as heck wouldn t be a great loss and it probably wouldn t be an accident   sen  john kerry  recovering from prostate surgery  was told it would be six weeks before he could be sexually active  john edwards called to wish kerry well  al sharpton called kerry to offer prayers  howard dean called with encouragement on recovery  bill clinton called teresa  before the inauguration  george w  was invited to a  get acquainted  tour of the white house   after drinking several glasses of iced tea  he asked president clinton if he could use his personal bathroom  he was astonished to see that the president had a solid gold urinal that afternoon  george w  told his wife  laura  about the urinal   just think   he said   when i am president  i ll have my own personal gold urinal  later  when laura had lunch with hillary at her tour of the white house  she told hillary how impressed george had been with his discovery of the fact that  in the president s private  bathroom  the president had a gold urinal  that evening  bill and hillary were getting ready for bed  hillary turned to bill and said   well  i found out who peed in your saxophone   an israeli doctor said   medicine in my country is so advanced  we can take a kidney out of one person  put it in another and have him looking for work in six weeks   \\n\\na german doctor said  that s nothing  in germany  we can take a lung out of one person  put it in another and have him looking for work in four weeks   \\n\\na russian doctor said   in my country  medicine is so advanced  we can take half a heart from one person  put it in another and have them both looking for work in two weeks   \\n\\nthe american doctor  not to be outdone  said  hah  we are about to take an butthole out of texas  put him in the white house and half the country will be looking

physical and psychological tests  he was told by the center s director that he was an acceptable candidate  that s great   the executive said   but i understand that this procedure can be really expensive   yes  sir  it can   the director replied   an ounce of accountant s brain for example  costs one thousand dollars  an ounce of an economist s brain costs two thousand  an ounce of a corporate president s is forty five thousand  an ounce of a democrat s brain is seventy five thousand dollars   seventy five thousand dollars for an ounce of a democrat s brain  why on earth is that   do you have any idea   the director asked   how many democrats we would have to kill   two friends are discussing politics on election day  each trying to no avail to convince the other to switch sides  finally  one says to the other    look  it s clear that we are unalterably opposed on every political issue  our votes will surely cancel out  why not save ourselves some time and both agree to not vote today    the other agrees enthusiastically and they part  shortly after that  a friend of the first one who had heard the conversation says    that was a sporting offer you made      not

farmer s field the old farmer heard the tragic crash so he rushed over to investigate  he then began digging a large grave to bury the politicians a few hours later  the local sheriff was driving past the farmer s field and noticed the bus wreck  he approached the old farmer and asked where all the politicians had gone  the old farmer explained that he d gone ahead and buried all of them   were they all dead   asked the puzzled sheriff   well  some of them said they weren t   said the old farmer   but you know how them politicians lie   the last four ex u s  presidents are caught in a

campaign  i m walking around taking up a collection for him   oh really  how much have you collected so far   so far only about three hundred gallons  but i ve got a lot of folks still siphoning   on

balloon realized she was lost she lowered altitude and spotted a man in a boat below  she shouted to him   excuse me  can you help me  i promised a friend i would meet him an hour ago  but i don t

minutes north latitude and 100 degrees  49 09 minutes west longitude  she rolled her eyes and said   you must be a republican  i am   replied the man   how did you know   well   answered the

responded   you must be a democrat   i am   replied the balloonist   how did you know   well   said the man   you don t know where you are or where you re going  you ve risen to where you are due to a large quantity of hot air  you made a promise that you have no idea how to keep  and you expect me to solve your problem  you re in exactly the sameposition you were in before we met  but somehow  now it s my fault   here are a few important observations  before the election campaign heats up republican boys always expect to grow up and marry republican girls and please their parents  but they always date democratic girls because they think they re entitled to a little fun first  democrats step on bugs republicans call an exterminator  democrats eat the big fish they catch republicans have them mounted  democrats sit on the dock and fish republicans expect to have someone else drive the boat  democrats make a lot of plans  but   don t do much with them republicans are still following the  plans their grandfathers made  a party of democrats was climbing in the alps   after several hours they became hopelessly lost  one of them studied the map for some time  turning it up and down

blonde  and a frightfully awful looking fat lady were in a train carriage  after several minutes of the trip  the train passes through a dark tunnel  and the unmistakable sound of a slap is heard  when they leave the tunnel  clinton has a big red slap mark on his cheek  the blonde thought   that rascal clinton wanted to touch me and by mistake he must have put his hand on the fat lady  who in

one wish  so   what ll it be   bill didn t hesitate  he said   i want to be remembered for bringing peace to the middle east  instead of that other stuff with monica  and jennifer  and the rest of those women  see this map  i want these countries to stop fighting with each other   the genie looked at the map of the middle east and exclaimed   jeez  fella  these people have been at war for thousands of years  i m good  but not that good  i don t think it can be done  make another wish   bill thought for a minute and said   you know  people really don t like my wife  even though she got elected  they call her a carpetbagger  they think she s mean  ugly  and pushes me around  i wish for her to be the most beautiful woman in the world and i want everybody to like her  that s what i

dispute with one dog fight  they would have 5 years to breed the best fighting dog in the world and whichever side s dog won would be entitled to dominate the world  \\n\\nosama found the biggest  meanest doberman and rottweiler female dogs in the world and bred them with the meanest siberian wolves  they selected only the biggest and strongest puppy from the litter  and removed his siblings  which gave him all the milk   after 5 years  they came up with the biggest  meanest dog the world had ever seen  its cage needed steel bars that were 5   thick and nobody could get near it  \\n\\nwhen the day came for the dog fight  bush showed up with a strange looking animal  it was a 9 foot long dachshund  everyone felt sorry for bush because there was no way that this dog could possibly last 10 seconds with the afghanistani dog  when the cages were opened up  the dachshund came out of it s cage  and slowly waddled over towards osama s dog  osama s dog snarled and leaped out of its cage and charged the american dachshund   but when it got close enough to bite  the dachshund opened its mouth and consumed osama s dog in one bite  there was nothing left of his dog at all  \\n\\nosama came up to bush  shaking his head in disbelief   we don t understand how this could have happened   we had our best people working for 5 years with the meanest doberman and rottweiler female dogs in the world and the biggest  meanest siberian wolves   \\n\\n that s nothing    said bush    we had michael jackson s plastic surgeons working for 5 years to make that alligator look like a weenie dog

the unmistakable  sound of a slap is heard    when they leave the tunnel   clinton has a big red slap mark  on his cheek     1  bo derek thought     that sleazeball clinton wanted  to touch me and by mistake  he must have put his hand on  janet reno  who in turn must  have slapped his face      2  janet reno thought     that dirty bill clinton laid  his hands on bo derek and  she smacked him      3  bill clinton thought     george put his hand on  bo derek and by mistake  she slapped me      4  george bush thought     i hope there s another  tunnel soon so i can  smack clinton again   after getting nailed by a daisy cutter  osama made his way to the pearly gates  there  he is greeted by george washington  how dare you attack the nation i helped conceive   yells mr  washington  slapping

 one day  george bush travels to afghanistan to attempt peace talks with osama bin laden         the two sit down to talk  and george asks him if peace was possible  then osama bin laden pushed a button  and a fist on a spring came out of the wall  and punched george in the face  george then asked if there was any way to settle their differences  and osama pushed another button  and the fist hit george in the nuts  george then asked to reschedule the talks in washington  osama agreed  and pushed another button that ejected george out of his seat         the two sat down in the oval office in washington d c  to continue their talks   osama claimed that filthy americans were trying to take over the world  and george pressed a button and nothing happens  osama than says   very funny  you think you are smarter than me    george pushes another button and still nothing happens  osama finished by stating no american is safe  and george pushed a third button  but once again  nothing happened  osama then said   enough of this nonsense  i need to go back to afghanistan  george bush simply replied   what afghanistan   an engineer  an accountant  a chemist and a bureaucrat were

pullets  and 8 or 10 roosters whose job was to fertilize the eggs my uncle kept records and any rooster or pullet that didn t perform well went into the pot and was replaced  now this took an awful lot of time  so when my uncle saw a set of eight tiny bells that each rang a different tone he promptly bought them he glued a piece of foam rubber to each clapper shaft so the bell wouldn t ring except when violently shaken  he hung a bell on each rooster s neck and went and mixed a mint julep  now he could sit on the porch and sip while filling out an efficiency report on the roosters by listening to the different tones of the bells and marking down each encounter  my uncle s favorite rooster was old brewster  brewster was a fine specimen  but his bell didn t ring all morning  uncle went to investigate several roosters were chasing pullets  bells a ringing  brewster had his bell in his beak so it couldn t ring  he d sneak up on a pullet  do his job and walk on to the next one

never having seen a baseball game before  he decides that now would be a good time  so  he goes to the park  and gets himself a bleacher seat now  paddy sees a guy step up to the plate with a stick in his hand  the guy standing on the hump of dirt throws a ball at the guy with the stick  who then  crack  hits the ball and starts running down the side  everyone around paddy stands up and shouts  run  run   a second guy steps up to the plate  and damn  if the guy on that hump of dirt doesn t throw that ball again  and again  the guy with the stick  crack  hits the ball and runs down the side  and again  everyone around paddy again  stands and shouts  run  run   now  a third guy steps up to the plate with a stick in his hands  this time  when the guy on the hump of dirt throws the ball  the guy with the stick doesn t do anything  and the guy squatting behind the guy with the stick tosses the ball back to the guy on the hump of dirt  and paddy is thinking to himself   what s happening  why didn t he hit the ball   this happens three more times  with paddy wondering more each time after the fourth time  the guy with the stick drops the stick and strolls up the side  now paddy stands up and shouts  run  run like hell   and the guy sitting next to paddy says that he doesn t have to run  so paddy asks him why  and is told that the batter has four balls so paddy shouts instead   walk

book store  where i saw a honk if you love jesus bumper sticker  i bought it and put it on the back bumper of my car  and i m really glad i did  what an uplifting experience followed  i was stopped at the light at a busy intersection  just lost in thought about the lord  and didn t notice that the light had changed  that bumper sticker really worked  i found lots of people who love jesus  why  the guy behind me started to honk like crazy  he must really love the lord because pretty soon  he leaned out his window and yelled   jesus christ   as loud as he could  it was like a football game with him shouting   go jesus christ  go   everyone else started honking  too  so i leaned out my window and waved and smiled to all of those loving people  there must have been a guy from florida back there because i could hear him yelling something about a sunny beach  and saw him waving in a funny way with only his middle finger stuck up in the air  i asked my two kids what that meant  they kind of squirmed  looked at each other  giggled and told me that it was the hawaiian good luck sign  so  i leaned out the window and gave him the good luck sign back  several cars behind  a very nice black man stepped out of his car and yelled something  i couldn t hear him very well  but it sounded like   mother trucker   or  mother s from there   maybe he was from florida  too  he must really love the lord  a couple of the people were so caught up in the joy of the moment that they got out of their cars and were walking toward me  i bet they wanted to pray  but just then i noticed that the light had changed to yellow  and stepped on the gas  and a good thing i did  because i was the only driver to get across the intersection  i looked back at them standing there  i leaned way out the window  gave them a big smile and held up the hawaiian good luck sign as i drove away  praise the lord for such wonderful folks  catholic mathlittle tommy was ding very badly in math  his parents had tried

his 12 year old sister sophie in tow  caught a large bull frog in a local pond  sidney started the experiment with the bull frog  and told sophie her job was to write down the results of the experiment sidney drew a line in the sand  placed the frog on the line  and prodded the frog with a small twig from the rear and shouted   jump frog  the frog jumped and sidney measured the distance   12 feet  write that down  sophie   he said next  he brought the frog back to the starting point and removed the frog s right front leg  again he prodded the frog and shouted   jump frog   the frog jumped 10 feet  and on instruction sophie wrote it down again the frog was brought back  and the left front leg was removed  and again said   jump frog   it jumped 6 feet and sophie wrote it down again sidney tried  this time removing the large right back leg   jump frog  jump frog   he shouted and prodded the frog  the frog jumped 8 inches   write it down  sophie  finally sidney removed the frog s remaining back left leg  put it down and prodded the frog with the twig  shouting  jump frog  jump frog  jump frog  jump  jump frog  the frog didn t jump  sophie looked at sidney  and said   so what should i write down  sidney thought a moment  and told sophie to write   when you remove all the legs from a frog  it turns deaf   during the  rush hour  at houston s hobby airport  a flight was

settling in  the flight attendant made the standard announcement   we apologize for the inconvenience of this last minute gate change  this flight is going to washington  d c  if your destination is

the trucking company s fancy lawyer was questioning farmer joe  didn t you say  at the scene of the accident   i m fine    said the lawyer farmer joe responded   well i ll tell you what happened  i had just loaded my favorite mule bessie into the      i didn t ask for any details   the lawyer interrupted   just answer the question  did you not say  at the scene of the accident   i m fine   farmer joe said   well i had just got bessie into the trailer and i was driving down the road     the lawyer interrupted again and said   judge  i am trying to establish the fact that  at the scene of the accident  this man told the highway patrolman on the scene that he was just fine  now several weeks after the accident he is trying to sue my client  i believe he is a fraud  please tell him to simply answer the question  by this time the judge was fairly interested in farmer joe s answer and said to the lawyer   i d like to hear what he has to say about his favorite mule bessie  joe thanked the judge and proceeded   well as i was saying  i had just loaded bessie  my favorite mule  into the trailer and was driving her down the highway when this huge semi truck and trailer ran the stop sign and smacked my truck right in the side  i was thrown into one ditch and bessie was thrown into the other  i was hurting real bad and didn t want to move  however  i could hear ole bessie moaning and groaning  i knew she was in terrible shape just by her groans  shortly after  a highway patrolman came on the scene  he could hear bessie moaning and groaning  so he went over to her  after he looked at her then he took out his gun and shot her between the eyes  then the patrolman came across the road with his gun in his hand and looked at me  he said  your mule was in such bad shape i had to shoot her  how are you feeling    a priest  a doctor  and an engineer were waiting one morning for a particularly slow group of golfers engineer  what s with these guys  we must have been waiting

for them engineer  why can t these guys play at night  during the height of the cold war  the americans and the russians realized that if they continued their arms race  they were going to blow up the whole planet they arranged a top secret summit  where it was decided to settle the whole dispute with one dog fight  they agreed to give each other5 years to breed the two most powerful fighting dogs ever the winning dog s country would be entitled to dominate the world  the losing side would have to submit and lay down its arms the russians searched their vast country to find the meanest  most vicious doberman and rottweiler breeds and crossed them with the biggest  most dangerous siberian wolves they selected only the biggest and strongest puppy from each litter and fed it a diet of steroids and trained them to be lethal attack dogs  after five years of fierce breeding  russiahad managed to create the biggest  most vicious dog the world had ever seen finally russia and america met in switzerland to let their dogs fight for world domination  although its cage had 4 inch thick reinforced steel bars  everyone was afraid to even go near the russian monster dog  when the russians saw the american dog  they burst into laughter  america had sent a weird looking 9 foot long dachshund  the russian breeders felt a little sorry for the dachshund  because they knew it didn t have the slightest chance to last even 10 seconds against russia s killer when the bell announced the beginning of the fight  the russian dog leaped out of its cage  snarled  and charged the american dachshund the dachshund slowly waddled out of its cage towards the russian dog  but just when the russian champion looked like it was going to bite the dachshund s neck  the dachshund opened its mouth and swallowed the russian dog with one bite  the russian monster was gone the russian politicians  shaking their heads in disbelief  walked over to the cheering americans and said   we don\\x91t understand how this could have happened  we had our best breeders working for five years with the meanest doberman and rottweiler breeds in the world and the biggest  meanest siberian wolves   that s nothing   an american replied   we had our best plastic surgeons working for five years to make an alligator look like a dachshund   a phone company puts an ad in the paper that they are recruiting workers the next day  two groups of workers show up  a crew of five italian men and a crew of five blonde women the company cannot decide whom to give the job to  so they give them a test  the company boss says   each crew will receive a telephone pole that they must install into the ground  whoever is able to hammer it in first  they will get the job  both groups agree that this is a fair test  so off they go in the company trucks with the long telephone poles sticking out the back a few hours pass  and finally  at 5 00  the italian crew returns  yay    they shout   we came back first  we get the job    good work  men   says the boss   however  we must wait until the other crew comes back to make sure that the reason they re delayed is not because of traffic  or that the truck broke down   fine  no problem   say the men an hour passes  two hours pass  three hours  finally  at 12 00  the blonde crew arrives  the entire group is flushed and breathing hard  as if they had just gone through harsh labor  what happened to you  what took so long   asks the boss incredulously  what do you mean   what took so long  do we get the job   you get the job  no way  the men were back here hours ago   well  of course they were   say the blondes   they only put the pole in halfway    when i was still a newlywed  i was invited out for a night with  the boys  being naive about these things at the

went home just as i got in the door  the cuckoo clock we had gotten as a wedding present started up and cuckooed three times  suddenly  i realized she d probably heard me come in the door  so i cuckooed another nine times  i was really proud of my fast thinking and having the quick wits  even when smashed  to escape a possible showdown the next morning my bride asked me what time i got in  i told her   midnight   whew  got away with that one she then told me that we needed a new cuckoo clock when i asked her why  she said   well  last night at midnight  it cuckooed three times  said  oh  no    cuckooed another five times  hiccoughed  cuckooed another four times  and then laughed hysterically   a man is a person who  if a woman says   never mind  i ll do it myself   lets her  a woman

before he had to head home  just as he was about to tee off an old gentleman shuffled onto the tee and asked if he could accompany the young man as he was golfing alone  not being able to say no  he allowed the old gent to join him to his surprise the old man played fairly quickly  he didn t hit the ball far  but plodded along consistently and didn t waste much time  finally  they reached the 9th fairway and the young man found himself with a tough shot  there was a large pine tree right in front of his ball   and directly between his ball and the green  after several minutes of debating how to hit the shot the old man finally said   you know  when i was your age i d hit the ball right over that tree   with that challenge placed before him  the youngster swung hard  hit the ball up  right smack into the top of the tree trunk and it thudded back on the ground not a foot from where it had originally lay  the old man offered one more comment  of course  when i was your age that pine tree was only 3 feet tall   bill clinton and his wife hilary were at a baseball game when the man sitting behind bill whispers something into bills ear  bill clinton stands up and throws hilary on the

of people called trids  the trids were happy except for the huge ogre that lived on the mountain  the ogre would periodically terrorize the trids the trids tired of the ogre and sought to reason with him they thought one of their religious leaders would be a good intermediary so a group of trids and their minister went up the mountain and before they could even say one word the ogre kicked them down the mountain  not being dismayed the trids thought that maybe the ogre was catholic  so they sent another delagation  this time led by the local priest but alas  as they approached the ogre he once again kicked them all down the mountain the trids were upset until they thought that perhaps the ogre was jewish  unfortunately  no trids were jewish  so they wrote to the people of another land and asked them to send a rabbi to help them with the ogre the rabbi arrived and led a delegation of trids up the mountain the ogre saw them coming and kicked all of them  except for the rabbi  down the mountain the rabbi  having been told of the previous expeditions  wondered why he alone had not been kicked down the mountain  so he asked the ogre the ogre laughed and replied  silly rabbi  kicks are for trids   celebrity why did the chicken 1  fox mulder  you saw it cross the road with your own eyes  how many more chickens have to cross the road before you believe it 2  bill gates  i have

of a very high wind  it blew the top off the ant farm and his creatures were gone practically in tears  he called me on the phone when i asked what was wrong  he replied       the ants are my friends

the guy hits a beautiful tee shot  275 yards down the middle  leaving himself a 6 iron to the green  the gorilla takes a few powerful practice swings and then laces the ball 450 yards  right at the pin  stopping about 6 inches away from the hole the guy turns to his friend and says  that s incredible  i would have never believed it if i hadn t seen it with my own eyes  but  you know what  i ve seen enough  i ve got no interest in being totally humiliated by this gorilla golfing machine  you send this frigging gorilla back to where he comes from  i need a drink  better make it a double  and

johnny violently in the groin  as he was doubling over  the farmer kicked him in the face  and when he hit the ground  he kicked him hard in the ribs after several moments  johnny slowly made it back

that night jimmy dropped bob off at nancy s house  but about two hours later bob rang jimmy s doorbell  jimmy asked   what are you doing here  does that mean she s not going to marry you after all

affair  and we admired him for it one day tragedy hit in the form of a very high wind  it blew the top off the ant farm and his creatures were gone practically in tears  he called me on the phone when i asked what was wrong  he replied       the ants are my friends  they re blowing in the wind  the ants are blowing inthe wind    a lady took her poodle to the parlor for a haircut  when she asked

the first lady but the other woman said   oh sire  do not spill innocentblood  let the other woman s daughter marry him  the wise king did not hesitate a moment   the attorney mustmarry the first lady

a dog which he was attempting to train  but alas had very little success  he was on the verge of despair when he happened across a very charismatic american evangelist  he unburdened his soul to the american  who promptly informed him to leave the dog with him  and he would have it trained in a jiffy the next day the man returns  and asks how the evangelist got on  the reply was positive  and the evangelist calls the dog to give a demonstration picking up a stick  he throws it and says  fetch   instantly the dog takes off  grabs the stick and returns  the evangelist says  drop  and the dog drops the stick at his feet   roll over  and the dog rolls over by this time the dog s owner is very excited  and asks if he can have a go  sure   replies the evangelist  heel   says the ownerand the

our daily bread  to  give us this day our daily chicken   and the pope responds   it is very tempting  colonel sanders  the church could do a lot of good with that much money  it would help us to support many charities  but again  i must decline  it is the lord s prayer  and i can t change the words  so the colonel gives up again after two more months of terrible sales  the colonel gets desperate   this is my final offer  your excellency  if you change the words of the daily prayer from  give us this day our daily bread  to  give us this day our daily chicken   i will donate  100

see up there are logging trucks  this morning all of the guys were diving off the rocks and swimming out in the lake  scoutmaster webb wouldn t let me because i can t swim and chad was afraid he would

 the man noticed clocks everywhere  there were grandfather clocks  wall clocks  watches  and clocks in every corner  it appeared that heaven was nothing more than a giant clock warehouse surprised at how heaven looked  the man asked st  peter what the deal was  why are all these clocks here in heaven  st peter replied  the clocks keep track of things on earth  there is one clock for each person  every time the person on earth tells a lie  his clock moves one minute  for instance  this clock is for sam  the used car salesman  if you watch it closely  it will move  click  the minute hand on sam s clock moved one minute  click  it moved another minute sam must be into closing a customer right now said st  peter  the minute hand on his clock moves all day the man and st peter continued walking  soon they came to a clock with cobwebs on the minute hand  whose clock is this  asked the man  that clock belongs to the widow mary  she is one of the finest  god fearing people on earth  i bet her clock hasn t moved in a year or two they continued walking and touring heaven  the man enjoyed watching the clocks of all of his friends  when the tour was over the man said    i ve seen everyone s

was on his morning run  accompanied by some secret service workers  dubya asked the boy what kind of puppies were in the box \\n\\nthe little boy said   republicans  \\n\\nthe president beamed  patted the boy on the head  and said   thatta boy  \\n\\na few weeks later bush was jogging again  this time with dick cheney in tow  bush stopped at the boy s house  winked at dick and said   hey kid  what kind of pupies are in the box  \\n\\nthe boy said   democrats \\n\\nbush looked crushed  saying   what happened  a few weeks ago they were republicans  \\n\\nthe boy said   well  the puppies opened their eyes   the answer to the eternal question  is it better to be a jock or a nerd michael jordan made over  300 000 a game  that equals  10 000 a minute  at an average of 30 minutes per game  with  40 million in endorsements  hemade  178 100 a day  working or not  if he sleeps 7 hours a night  he makes  52 000 every night while visions of sugarplums dance in his head  if he goes to see a movie  it ll cost him  7 00  but he ll make  18 550 while he s there  if he decides to have a 5 minute egg  he ll make  618 while boiling it  he makes  7 415 hr more than minimum wage  he ll make  3 710 while watching each episode of friends  if he wanted to save up for a new acura nsx   90 000  it would take him a whole 12 hours  if someone were to hand him his salary and endorsement money  they would have to do it at the rate of  2 00 every second  he ll probably pay around  200 for a nice round of golf  but will be reimbursed  33 390 for that round  assuming he puts the federal maximum of 15  of his income into a tax deferred account  401k   he will hit the federal cap of  9500 at 8 30 a m  on january 1st  if you were given a penny for every 10 dollars he made  you  d be living comfortably at  65 000 a year  he ll make about  19 60 while watching the 100 meter dash in the olympics  he ll make about  15 600 during the boston marathon  while the common person is spending about  20 for a meal in his trendy chicago restaurant  he ll pull in about  5600  in his last year  he made more than twice as much as all u s  past presidents for all of their terms combined  amazing isn t it  keep reading but   if jordan saves 100  of his income for the next 250 years  he ll still have less than bill gates has today  game over  nerd wins  one day a traveling salesman was driving down a back country road at about 30 miles an hour when he noticed that there was a three legged chicken running along beside his car  he stepped on the gas but at 50 miles per hr  the chicken was still

knocked at the door and when the farmer answered he told him what he had just seen  the farmer said that he knew about the chicken  as a matter of fact the farmer said that his son was a geneticist

the same to him  he began to get upset  he had stayed up all night studying and now had to identify birds by their legs  the more he thought about it the madder he got  finally he could stand it no longer  he went up to the professor s desk and said   what a stupid test  how could anyone tell the difference between birds by looking at their legs   with that the student threw his test on the professor s desk and walked to the door  the professor was surprised  the class was so big that he didn t know every student s name so as the student reached the door the professor called   mister

so he goes to a local sports shop and sees a duck hunting magazine and thinks to himself that it would be a challenge  so he goes out and buys all the stuff for duck hunting  the man goes to a remote area and lays his fake ducks out on the pond nearby  he hides in the tall grass and pulls out his duck whistle and starts blowing  all of a sudden there are dozens of ducks flying by and he starts to shoot at them  he does this several times that day  at the end of the day he feels good about his new hobby and starts to look for all the ducks that he shot down  \\n\\nafter collecting all the ducks the man heads back to his car and out of nowhere a park ranger appears and says to the man  hello sir  how are you doing today   the man says proudly  with his chest sticking out  i m doing great   it

hunting license   sure no problem  the man says   may i take a look at those ducks   the ranger says politely  sure  they re real beauties    help yourself  replied the man  so the ranger puts on some gloves and takes out the first duck    he then proceeds to put his finger up the ducks butt  he looks at the man and says  hmmmm    this duck is from montana   the man is confused and thinks to himself that this ranger is weird  \\n\\n\\nthe ranger asks the man if he has a tag for hunting ducks in montana on his license   no  the man says nervously  so the ranger says  i m sorry but i m gonna have too give you a  1000 citation   upset and confused the man doesn t say anything  he s shocked  so the ranger takes another duck out of the man s bag and again sticks his finger up the ducks butt   hmmmm    this duck is from florida  do you have a tag for that   the ranger says to the man  \\n\\nthe man turns furiously red and replies  no    well i guess i m afraid that s another  1000 citation that i have to issue you   the ranger replies  by this time the man is completely baffled and has never heard such bullcrap before  the ranger finally takes the last duck out of the bag and puts his finger up the ducks butt   hmmm    this duck is from colorado  i suppose you don t have a tag for that either   the ranger says to the man  \\n noooo   shouts the man   well i guess i m gonna

farmer explained that he had only two beds  and one of the three had to sleep in the barn with the animals  the three quickly agreed the rabbi said he would sleep in the barn and let the other two have the beds  ten minutes after the rabbi left  there was a knock on the bedroom door  the rabbi entered exclaiming  i can t sleep in the barn there is a pig in there  it s against my religion to sleep in the same room with a pig  the hindu said he would sleep in the barn  as he had no religious problem with pigs  however  about five minutes later  the hindu burst through the bedroom door saying  there s a cow in the barn  i can t sleep in the same room as a cow  it s against my religion  the lawyer  anxious to get to sleep  said he d go to the barn  as he had no problem sleeping with animals in two minutes  the bedroom door burst open and the pig and the cow says    a lawyer opened the door of his bmw  when suddenly a car came along and hit the door  ripping it off completely

great time  she comes up on this trucker who is carrying a double wide home and is taking up both lanes  to her disliking  he is only going about 45  to get the point across that she wants to get past  she decides to tailgate him  so  she gets to within a foot of his rear bumper  the trucker looks back and sees her on his ass  and motions for her to get off of it  but to her it looks like a wave and she waves back  since her first attempt was futile  she decided to get a little closer and begin flashing her headlights  hopefully making herself more visible in the process  once again the trucker sees her on his ass  and this time motions for her to pull over to the side of the road  the trucker steps out of his vehicle with a chunk of chalk and draws a circle three feet in diameter in the middle of the road  he instructs her not to move until he tells her to  naive as she was  she agrees to it and steps inside it  the trucker goes back to his truck and pulls out a 50 ounce louisville slugger  he walks over to the lamborghini and beats it  and beats it  and beats it again  when he is done  all that is left is a brand new  candy apple red   125 000 pile of metal

my eye    you re kidding   said the bartender   you couldn t have lost an eye just from some bird crap    well  i really wasn t used to the hook yet   in march 1992 a man living in newton near boston massachusetts received a bill for his as yet unused credit card stating that he owed  0 00  he ignored it and threw it away  in april he received another and threw that one away too  the following month the credit card company sent him a very nasty note stating they were going to cancel his card if he didn t send them  0 00 by return of post  he called them  talked to them  they said it was a computer error and told him they d take care of it  the following month he decided that it was about time that he tried out the troublesome credit card figuring that if there were purchases on his account it would put an end to his ridiculous predicament  however  in the first store that he produced his credit card in payment for his purchases he found that his card had been canceled  he called the credit card company who apologized for the computer error once again and said that they would take care of it  the next day he got a bill for  0 00 stating that payment was now overdue  assuming that having spoken to the credit card company only the previous day the latest bill was yet another mistake he ignored it  trusting that the company would be as good as their word and sort the problem out  the next month he got a bill for  0 00 stating that he had 10 days to pay his account or the company would have to take steps to recover the debt  finally giving in  he thought he would play the company at their own game and mailed them a check for  0 00  the computer duly processed his account and returned a statement to the effect that he now owed the credit card company nothing at all  a week later  the man s bank called him asking him what he was doing writing a check for  0 00  after a lengthy explanation the bank replied that the  0 00 check had caused their check processing software to fail  the bank could not now process any checks from any of their customers that day because the check for  0 00 was causing the computer to crash  the following month the man received a letter from the credit card company claiming that his check had bounced and that he now owed them  0 00 and unless he sent a check by return of post they would be taking steps to recover the debt  the

examination table and sat across from him  jesus peered at the old man and asked   what was it you did for a living   the old man replied   i was a carpenter   jesus remembered his own earthly existence and leaned forward   did you have any family   he asked   yes  i had a son  but i lost him   jesus leaned forward some more   you lost our son  can you tell me about him    well  he had

carrying a bag of money  she insisted that she must speak with the president of the bank to open a savings account because   it s a lot of money  after much hemming and hawing  the bank staff finally ushered her into the president s office  the customer is always right  the bank president then asked her how much she would like to deposit  she replied    165 000   and dumped the cash out of her bag onto his desk the president was of course curious as to how she came by all this cash  so he asked her   ma am  i m surprised you re carrying so much cash around   where did you get all of this money  the old lady replied   i make bets  the president then asked   bets  what kind of bets  the old woman said   well  for example  i ll bet you  25 000 that your balls are square   ha   laughed the president   that s a stupid bet  you can never win that kind of bet  the old lady challenged   so  would you like to take my bet   sure   said the president   i ll bet  25 000 that my balls are not square  the little old lady then said   okay  but since there is a lot of money involved  may i bring my lawyer with me tomorrow at 10 00 am as a witness   sure   replied the confident president that night  the president got very nervous about the bet and spent a long time in front of the mirror checking his balls  turning from side to side  again and again  he thoroughly checked them out until he was sure there was absolutely no way his balls were square and that he would win the bet the next morning  at precisely 10 00 am  the little old lady appeared with her lawyer at the president s office  she introduced the lawyer to the president and repeated the bet    25 000 says the president s balls are square  the president agreed with the bet again and the old lady asked him to drop his pants so they could all see  the president did  the little old lady peered closely at his balls and then asked if she could feel them   well  okay   said the president    25 000 is a lot of money  so i guess you should be absolutely sure  just then  he noticed that the lawyer was quietly banging his head against the wall  the president asked the old lady   what the hell s the matter with your lawyer  she replied   nothing  except that i bet him  100 000 that at 10 00 am today  i d have the bank of canada s president s balls in my hand    do you believe in life after death   the boss asked one of

 and after a while saw two men with spears  standing still in the water   they must be the  ole boys  he thought  just at that point he noticed an alligator moving in the water towards one of them  the guy stood completely passive  even as the gator came ever closer  just as the beast was about to swallow him  he struck home with his spear and wrestled the gator up onto the beach  where several already laying together the two guys threw the gator onto its back  where upon one exclaimed  darn  this one doesn t have any shoes either    at 3 am a desk clerk at a hotel gets a call from a drunk

good cigars and we have so much of them  that we can just throw them away      saying that  he throws the pack of havanas through the window  one more time  everybody is quite impressed at this time

but me   two deaf men were talking on their coffee break  about being out late the night before  the first man said   my wife was asleep when i got home  so i was able to sneak into bed  and not get into trouble   the second deaf man said    boy you re lucky  my wife was wide awake  waiting for me in bed  and she started swearing at me and giving me hell for being out so late   the first deaf man asked    so what did you do    i turned out the light   the second man replied  a lawyer and a blonde are sitting next to each other on a long flight from la to ny  the lawyer leans over to her and asks if she would like to play a fun game  the blonde just wants to take a nap  so she politely declines and rolls over to the window to catch a few winks  the lawyer persists and explains that the

right  coach   replied the lineman   but  she s much better   the huge college freshman decided to try out for the football team   can you tackle   asked the coach   watch this   said the freshman  who proceeded to run smack into a telephone pole  shattering it to splinters   wow   said the coach   i m impressed  can you run  \\n\\n of course i can run   said the freshman  he was off like a shot  and  in just over nine seconds  he had run a hundred yard dash   great   enthused the coach   but can you pass a football   the freshman hesitated for a few seconds   well  sir   he said   if i can

cut a hole in the ice  dropped in his fishing line  and waited patiently for a bite  he was there for almost an hour  without even a nibble  when a young boy walked out onto the ice  cut a hole in the ice next to him  \\n\\nthe young boy dropped his fishing line and minutes later he hooked a largemouth bass  the old man couldn t believe his eyes but chalked it up to plain luck  shortly thereafter  the young boy pulled in another large catch  the young boy kept catching fish after fish \\n\\nfinally  the old man couldn t take it any longer   son  he said   i ve been here for over an hour without even a nibble  you ve been here only a few minutes and have caught a half dozen fish  how do you do it   \\n\\nthe boy responded   roo raf roo reep ra rums rrarm    what was that   the old man asked  again the boy responded   roo raf roo reep ra rums rarrm    look   said the old man   i can t understand a word you re saying   the boy spat the bait into his hand and said     you have to keep the worms warm   an american investment banker was at the pier of a small coastal mexican village when a small boat with just one fisherman docked  inside the small boat were several large yellow fin tuna  the american complimented the mexican on the quality of his fish and asked how long it took to catch them  \\n\\nthe mexican replied   only a little while   the american then asked   why didn t you stay out longer and catch more fish   the mexican said   with this i have more than enough to support my family s needs   the american then asked   but what do you do with the rest of your time   \\n\\nthe mexican fisherman said   i sleep late  fish a little  play with my children  take siesta with my wife  maria  stroll into the village each evening where i sip wine and play guitar with my amigos  i have a full and busy life  \\n\\nthe american scoffed   i am a harvard mba and could help you  you should spend more time fishing  and with the proceeds  buy a bigger boat  with the proceeds from the bigger boat you could buy several boats  eventually you would have a fleet of fishing boats  instead of selling your catch to a middleman you would sell directly to the processor  eventually opening your own cannery  you would control the product  processing and distribution  you would need to leave this small coastal fishing village and move to mexico city  then los angeles and eventually new york where you will run your ever expanding enterprise  \\n\\nthe mexican fisherman asked   but  how long will this all take   to which the american replied   15 to 20 years    but what then   asked the mexican  the american laughed and said that s the best part   when the time is right you would announce an ipo and sell your company stock to the public and become very rich  you would make millions   \\n\\n millions    then what   the american said   then you would retire  move to a small coastal fishing village where you would sleep late  fish a little  play with your kids

could see the flag  but not the green  \\n\\neach hit their ball anyway  when they walked to the green  they discovered one ball about three feet from the cup  while the other ball somehow had gone directly in  the blondes tried to figure out which ball belonged to who  since they were both using titleist number threes  \\n\\nunable to decide  they returned to the club house and asked the golf pro for a ruling  after hearing their story and congratulating them both on their superb shots under such adverse conditions the pro asked   okay  so who was playing the yellow ball   two friends went out to play golf and were about to tee off  when one fellow noticed that his partner had but one golf ball   don t you have at least one other golf ball   he asked  the other guy replied that no  he only needed the one   are you sure   the friend persisted   what happens if you lose that ball   \\n\\nthe other guy replied   this is a very special golf ball  i won t lose it so i don t need another one    well   the friend asked   what happens if you miss your shot and the ball goes in the lake    that s okay   he replied   this special golf ball floats  i ll be able to retrieve it   \\n\\n well what happens if you hit it into the trees and it gets lost among the bushes and shrubs   the other guy replied   that s okay too  you see  this special golf ball has a homing beacon  i ll be able to get it back   no problem  \\n\\nexasperated  the friend asks   okay  let s say our game goes late  the sun goes down  and you hit your ball into a sand trap  what are you going to do then    no problem   says the other guy   you see  this ball is florescent  i ll be able to see it in the dark   finally satisfied that he needs only the one golf ball  the friend asks   hey  where did you get a golf ball like that anyway   the other guy replies   i found it   after a particularly poor game of golf  a popular club member skipped the clubhouse and started to go home  as he was walking to the parking lot to get his car  a policeman stopped him and asked   did you tee off on the sixteenth hole about twenty minutes ago   \\n\\n yes   the golfer responded  \\n\\n did you happen to hook your ball so that it went over the trees and off the course   the cop asked   yes  i did  how did you know   the golfer asked  \\n\\n well   said the policeman very seriously   your ball flew out onto the highway and crashed through a driver s windshield  the car went out of control  crashing into five other cars and a fire truck  the fire truck couldn t make it to the fire  and the building burned down  so  what are you going to do about it   \\n\\nthe golfer thought it over carefully and responded   i think i ll close my stance a little bit  tighten my grip and lower my right thumb   one recent sunday  a young boy arrived to his sunday school class late  his teacher knew that the boy was usually very prompt and asked him if anything was wrong \\n\\nthe boy replied no  that he was going to go fishing  but that his dad told him that he needed to go to church instead  the teacher was very impressed and asked the boy if his father had explained to him why it was more important to go to church rather than to go fishing  to which the boy replied   yes  ma am  he did  my dad said that he didn t have enough bait for both of us   an irish priest loved to fly fish  it was an obsession of his  so far this year the weather had been so bad that he hadn t had a chance to get his beloved waders on and his favorite flies out of their box  \\n\\nstrangely though  every sunday the weather had been good  but of course sunday is the day he has to go to work  the weather forecast was good again for the coming sunday so he called a fellow priest claiming to have lost his voice and be in bed with the flu  \\n\\nhe asked him to take over his sermon  the fly fishing priest drove fifty miles to a river near the coast so that no one would recognize him  an angel up in heaven was keeping watch and saw what the priest was doing  he told god who agreed that he would do something about it \\n\\nwith the first cast of his line a huge fish mouth gulped down the fly  for over an hour the priest ran up and down the river bank fighting the fish  at the end when he finally landed the monster size fish it turned out to be a world record salmon \\n\\nconfused the angel asked god   why did you let him catch that huge fish  i thought you were going to teach him a lesson   god replied  i did  who do you think he s going to tell   last winter  while sports fishing off the florida coast  a tourist capsized his boat  the guy could swim  but his fear of alligators kept him clinging to the overturned craft \\n\\nspotting an old beachcomber standing on the shore  the tourist shouted   are there any gators around here     naw   the man hollered back   they ain t been around for years    feeling safe  the tourist started swimming leisurely toward the shore  about halfway there he asked the guy   how did you get rid of the gators    we didn t do nothin    the beachcomber said   the sharks got  em   the fishing season hasn t opened and a fisherman who doesn t have a license  is casting for trout as a stranger approaches and asks  any luck  \\n any luck  this is a wonderful spot  i took 10 out of this stream yesterday  he boasts \\n is that so  by the way  do you know who i am   asks the stranger \\n nope    well  meet the new game warden  \\n oh   gulped the fisherman   well  do you know who i am  \\n nope  \\n meet the biggest liar in the state   there s this guy in a bar  just looking at his drink  he stays like that for half an hour  then  this big trouble making truck driver steps next to him  takes the drink from the guy and just drinks it all down \\n\\nthe poor man starts crying  the truck driver says   come on man  i was just joking  here  i ll buy you another drink  i just can t see a man crying  \\n\\n no  it s not that  this day is the worst of my life  first  i fall asleep  and i go late to my office  my boss  outrageous  fires me  when i leave the building  to my car  i found out it was stolen  the police  they say they can do nothing  i get a cab to return home and when i leave it  i remember i left my wallet and credit cards there  the cab driver just drives away  i go home  and when i get there  i find my wife in bed with the gardener  i leave home  and come to this bar \\n\\nand just when i was thinking about putting an end to my life  you show up and drink my poison     the day finally arrived  forrest gump dies and goes to heaven \\n\\nhe is met at the pearly gates by saint peter himself  the gates are closed  however  and forrest approaches the gatekeeper \\n\\nsaint peter says   well  forrest  it s certainly good to see you  we have heard a lot about you \\n\\ni must inform you that the place is filling up fast  and we ve been administering an entrance exam for everyone  the tests are fairly short  but you need to pass before you can get into heaven  \\n\\nforrest responds   it shore is good to be here  saint peter  i was looking forward to this  nobody ever told me about any entrance exams shore hope the test ain t too hard  life was a big enough test as it was  \\n\\nsaint peter goes on   yes  i know forrest  but  the test i have has only three questions  here is the first  what days of the week begin with the letter  t   second  how many seconds are there in a year  third  what is god s first name  \\n\\nforrest goes away to think the questions over  forrest returns the next day and goes up to saint peter to try to answer the exam questions \\n\\nsaint peter waves him up and asks   now that you have had a chance to think the questions over  tell me your answers  \\nforrest says   well  the first one  how many days of the week begin with the letter  t  shucks  that one s easy  that d be today and tomorrow  \\n\\nthe saint s eyes opened wide and he exclaims   forrest  that s not what i was thinking  but   you do have a point though  and i guess i didn t specify  so i give you credit for that answer  how about the next one   says saint peter   how many seconds in a year  \\n\\n now that one s harder   says forrest   but  i thunk and thunk about that  and i guess the only answer can be twelve  \\n\\nastounded  saint peter says   twelve  twelve  forrest  how could you come up with twelve seconds in a year  \\n\\nforrest says   shucks  there gotta be twelve  january second  february second  march second        \\n\\n hold it   interrupts saint peter   i see where you re going with it  and i guess i see your point  though that wasn t quite what i had in mind  i ll give you credit for that one too  \\n\\n let s go on with the next and final question   says saint peter   can you tell me god s first name  \\n\\nforrest says   well  shore  i know god s first name  everybody knows it  it s howard  \\n\\n howard    asks saint peter   what makes you think it s howard   \\n\\nforrest answers   it s in the prayer  \\n\\n the prayer   asks saint peter   which prayer  \\n\\n you know  the lord s prayer   responds forrest       \\n\\n our father  which art in heaven  howard be thy name        two men were adrift in a life boat following a dramatic escape from a burning freight vessel  while rummaging through the boat s provisions  one of the men stumbled across an old lamp  secretly hoping that a genie would appear  he rubbed the lamp vigorously  to the amazement of the castaways  a genie did appear \\n\\nthis particular genie  however  stated that she could only deliver one wish  not the standard three  without giving much thought to the matter the man blurted out   make the entire ocean into beer  \\n\\nimmediately the genie clapped her hands with a deafening crash  and the entire sea turned to the finest brew ever sampled by mortals  simultaneously  the genie vanished to her freedom  only the gentle lapping of beer on the hull broke the sudden stillness as the the two men considered their circumstances \\n\\nthe other man looked disgustedly at the one who s wish had been granted  after a long  tension filled moment  he spoke   nice going  now we re going to have to pee in the boat    a wise old gentleman retired and purchased a modest home near a junior high school  he spent the first few weeks of his retirement in peace and contentment \\n\\nthen a new school year began  the very next afternoon three young boys full of youthful after school enthusiasm came down his street beating merrily on every trash can they encountered  the crashing percussion continued day after day  until finally the wise old man decided it was time to take some action \\n\\nthe next afternoon  he walked out to meet the young percussionists as they banged their way down the street  stopping them  he said   you kids are a lot of fun  i like to see you express your exuberance like that  i used to do the same thing when i was your age  will you do me a favor  i ll give you each two dollars if you ll promise to come around every day and do your thing  \\n\\nthe kids were elated and continued to do a bang up job on the trashcans  a few days later  the wily retiree approached them again as they drummed their way down the street   look   he said   i haven t received my social security  pension  check yet  so i m not going to be able to give you more than 25 cents  will that be okay  \\n\\n a lousy quarter   the drum leader exclaimed   if you think we re going to waste our time beating these cans around for a quarter  you re nuts  no way  mister  we quit  \\n\\nand the old man enjoyed peace and serenity for the rest of his days  three old men are at the doctor for a memory test  the doctor says to the first old man   what is three times three  \\n\\n 274  was his reply \\n\\nthe doctor says to the second man   it s your turn  what is three times three  \\n\\n tuesday   replies the second man \\n\\nthe doctor says to the third man   ok  your turn  what s three times three  \\n\\n nine   says the third man \\n\\n that s great   says the doctor   how did you get that  \\n\\n simple   says the third man   i subtracted 274 from tuesday   unable to attend the funeral after his father died  a son who lived far away called his brother and told him   do something nice for dad and send me the bill  \\n\\nlater  he got a bill for  200 00  which he paid  the next month  he got another bill for  200 00  which he also paid  figuring it was some incidental expense \\n\\nbills for  200 00 kept arriving every month  and finally the man called his brother again to find out what was going on \\n\\n well   said the other brother   you said to do something nice for dad  so i rented him a tuxedo   a young man was walking through a super market to pick up a few things when he noticed an old lady following him \\n\\n excuse me   he said   can i help you  \\n\\n oh  pardon me   the old woman replied   i m sorry if my staring has made you uncomfortable  but you look just like my son  he died recently and i never got to say goodbye  \\n\\n i m very sorry   replied the young man   is there anything i can do for you  \\n\\n yes   she said   as i m leaving  would you say  goodbye  mother   it would make me feel so much better  \\n\\n sure   answered the young man  as the old woman was leaving  he called out   goodbye  mother  \\n\\nthen  as he stepped up to the checkout counter  he saw that his total was nearly  200 \\n\\n how can that be   he asked   i only purchased a few things  \\n\\nthe clerk replied   your mother said you d pay for her   the old man was setting on his porch  when a young man walked up with a pad and pencil in his hand   what are you selling  young man   the elderly gentleman asked \\n\\n i m not selling anything  sir   the young man replied   i m a census taker  \\n\\n a what   the old man asked \\n\\n a census taker  we are trying to find out how many people are in the country  \\n\\n well   the man answered   you re wasting your time with me    i have no idea   an elderly woman decided to have her portrait painted  she told the artist   paint me with diamond earrings  a diamond necklace  emerald bracelets  a ruby broach  and gold rolex  \\n\\n but you re not wearing any of those things   replied the artist \\n\\n i know   she said   it s in case i should die before my husband  i m sure he will remarry right away  and i want his new wife to go crazy looking for the jewelry   a young reporter went to a retirement home to interview an aged but legendary explorer  the reporter asked the old man to recount the most frightening experience he had ever had \\n\\n once i was hunting bengal tigers in the jungles of india   the old explorer said   i was pushing through the brush on a narrow trail  suddenly the largest tiger i have ever seen leaped onto the path in front of me  i grabbed my rifle and fired instantly  only to find that it had jammed  the tiger leapt toward me with a mighty roarrr  i soiled\\nmyself  \\n\\nthe reporter felt somewhat embarassed for the old man   under those circumstances   he said   i think anyone would have done the same  \\n\\n no  no   the old explorer said   not then   just now when i went roarrr   a woman goes into the local newspaper office to see that the\\nobituary for her recently deceased husband is written  the obituary editor informs her that the fee for the obituary is 50 cents a word  she pauses  reflects and then says   well then  let it read   fred brown died   \\n\\namused at the woman s thrift  the editor tells her that there is a 7 word minimum for all obituaries  only a little flustered  she thinks things over and in a few seconds says   in that case

deep outside  and inside  their house  one family spent its time sitting on the porch roof  watching the wreckage float by \\n\\nthe son happened to notice a nice straw hat as it went downstream   my   he thought   i ll bet the person who lost that hat is sorry now  \\n\\nafter the hat had floated out of sight around the corner of the house  the boy kept watching the river  suddenly  much to his surprise  here comes the hat  floating upstream  against the current \\n\\nthis was obviously very strange  so the lad kept his eye on it  it floated upstream and around the other corner of the house    and came floating back down again  after a while  it came back upstream yet again  rounding the corner of the house \\n\\nfinally  the boy could stand it no longer and pointed out the hat to his mother  asking her whatever could cause such a sight  his mother replied   oh  that s just your grandfather  he swore it d take more than a few drops of rain to keep him from mowing the lawn today   an old man went to the doctor for his yearly physical  his wife came along to keep him company  the doctor checked his reflexes  looked down his throat  and listened to his chest with a stethescope  he made a few notes and said   i need a urine sample  a stool sample  and a sperm sample  \\n\\n what   said the old man  being hard of hearing \\n\\n i need a urine sample  a stool sample  and a sperm sample   repeated the doctor loudly \\n\\n what did he say   shouted the old man  looking at his wife   what s he want  \\n\\nhis wife yelled into his ear   he needs your underwear   ant

assurance\\nabout how a disposal can t start itself will calm the fears of a person\\nwho suffers from  big ol scary machine phobia   a condition brought on\\nby watching too many stephen king movies \\n\\nit is futile to argue or explain  kind of like telling\\nlloyd bentsen americans are over taxed  and if a poltergeist did  in fact \\npossess the disposal  and she was ground into round  i d have to live with\\nthat the rest of my life \\n\\nso out i came  dripping wet and buck naked  hoping to\\nmake a statement about how her cowardly behavior was  not without consequence \\nbut it was i who would suffer  i crouched down and stuck my head under\\nthe sink to find the button \\n\\nit is the last action i remember performing  it struck\\nwithout warning  without respect to my circumstances  nay  it wasn t a\\nhexed disposal  drawing me into its gnashing metal teeth  it was our new\\nkitty  clawing playfully at the dangling objects she spied between my legs \\nshe   buttons  aka  the grater   had been poised around the corner and\\nstalked me as i took the bait under the sink  at precisely the second i\\nwas most vulnerable  she leapt at the toys i unwittingly offered and snagged\\nthem with her needle like claws \\n\\nnow when men feel pain or even sense danger anywhere close\\nto their masculine region  they lose all rational thought to control orderly\\nbodily movements  instinctively  their nerves compel the body to contort\\ninwardly  while rising upwardly at a violent rate of speed  not even a\\nwell trained monk could calmly stand with his groin supporting the full\\nweight of a kitten and rectify the situation in a step by step procedure \\nwild animals are sometimes faced with a  fight or flight  syndrome  men \\nin this predicament  choose only the  flight  option \\n\\nfleeing straight up  i knew at that moment how a cat feels\\nwhen it is alarmed  it was a dismal irony  but  whereas cats seek great\\nheights to escape  i never made it that far  the sink and cabinet bluntly\\nimpeded my ascent  the impact knocked me out cold \\n\\nwhen i awoke  my wife and the paramedics stood over me \\nhaving been fully briefed by my wife  the

important to start any fitness program only when you feel like it  don t let a few extra pounds intimidate you into becoming more active  the most important aspect of fitness is  when to start the program  the best time is at about 2 a m  the house is quiet  there are no distractions  the warm up is critical  cats are experts at stretching  so this won t be a problem  start with a few\\nwind sprints  full speed  toenails clicking on the tile or linoleum floors  a few low but loud growls will help you feel charged up \\n\\nnow it is time to add some eye paw coordination work  find a marble  the big steelies work even better  and roll that down the floor as the sprints continue  see how many times you can ricochet it off the wallboards before it disappears under the fridge  finally  work on that upper body strength  climbing is a great exercise  use draperies  macramé plant hangers  or clothing on hangers  you can even find some carpeting on some basement walls  backs of chairs work well  too \\n\\nnow put it all together  a speed sprint to the end of the hall  a race around the living room  leap to the back of the rocking chair  let the rebound launch you to the top of the swinging planter  rock that baby  feel those muscles work  just as the hook pulls loose from the ceiling  dash to the bedroom and dive under the covers  establish your alibi just in time to hear the

it has in mine  i have some\\nadvice you might consider as you place your feline friend under you arm\\nand head for the bathtub \\n\\n  know that although the cat has the advantage of quickness and lack\\nof concern for human life  you have the advantage of strength  capitalize\\non that advantage by selecting the battlefield  don t try to bathe him\\nin an open area where he can force you to chase him  pick a very small\\nbathroom  if your bathroom is more than four feet square  i recommend that\\nyou get in the tub with the cat and close the sliding glass doors as if\\nyou were about to take a shower   a simple shower curtain will not do \\na berserk cat can shred a three ply rubber shower curtain quicker than\\na politician can shift positions  \\n\\n  know that a cat has claws and will not hesitate to remove all the\\nskin from your body  your advantage here is that you are smart and know\\nhow to dress to protect yourself  i recommend canvas overalls tucked into\\nhigh top construction boots  a pair of steel mesh gloves  an army helmet \\na hockey face mask and a long sleeve flak jacket \\n\\n  prepare everything in advance  there is no time to go out for a towel\\nwhen you have a cat digging a hole in your flak jacket  draw the water \\nmake sure the bottle of kitty shampoo is inside the glass enclosure  make\\nsure the towel can be reached  even if you are lying on your back in the\\nwater \\n\\n  use the element of surprise  pick up your cat nonchalantly  as if\\nto simply carry him to his supper dish   cats will not usually notice your\\nstrange attire  they have little or no interest in fashion as a rule  if\\nhe does notice your garb  calmly explain that you are taking part in a\\nproduct  testing experiment for j c  penney  \\n\\n  once you are inside the bathroom  speed is essential to survival \\nin a single liquid motion  shut the bathroom door  step into the tub enclosure \\nslide the glass door shut  dip the cat in the water and squirt him with\\nshampoo  you have begun one of the wildest 45 seconds of your life  cats\\nhave no handles  add the fact that he now has soapy fur  and the problem\\nis radically compounded  do not expect to hold on to him for more that\\ntwo or three seconds at a time  when you have him  however  you must remember\\nto give him another squirt of shampoo and rub like crazy  he ll then spring\\nfree and fall back into the water  thereby rinsing himself off   the national\\nrecord is   for cats   three latherings  so don t expect too much  \\n\\n  next  the cat must be dried  novice cat bathers always assume this\\npart will be the most difficult  for humans generally are worn out at this\\npoint and the cat is just getting really determined  in fact  the drying\\nis simple compared to what you have just been through  that s because by\\nnow the cat is semi permanently affixed to your right leg  you simply pop\\nthe drain plug with your foot  reach for your towel and wait   occasionally \\nhowever  the cat will end up clinging to the top of your army helmet  if\\nthis happens  the best thing you can do is to shake him loose and to encourage\\nhim toward your leg   after all the water is drained from the tub  it is\\na simple matter to just reach down and dry the cat \\n\\nin a few days the cat will relax enough to be removed from your leg \\nhe will usually have nothing to say for about three weeks and will spend\\na lot of time sitting with his back to you  he might even become psychoceramic\\nand develop the fixed stare of a plaster figurine \\n\\nyou will be tempted to assume he is angry  this isn t usually the case \\nas a rule he is simply plotting ways to get through your defenses and injure\\nyou for life the next time you decide to give him a bath  but  at least\\nnow he smells a lot better is your devotion to your cat and  cat things  in the training stage  at a moderate level  or extreme  or are you an all out shameless  cat a holic  \\nlet s just see how you rate as a  cat person   shall we  see how many of these can you give an honest  yes  answer to  now i lay me down to sleep \\ni pray this cushy life to keep \\ni pray for toys that look like

bedtime \\n\\nalways sleep on the human at night so s he cannot move round \\n\\n   play \\n\\nthis is an important part of your life  get enough sleep in the daytime\\nso you are fresh for your nocturnal games  below are listed several favorite\\ncat games that you can play  it is important though to maintain one s dignity\\nat all times  if you should have an accident during play  such as falling\\noff a chair  immediately wash a part of your body as if to say  i meant\\nto do that   it fools those humans every time \\n\\ncat games \\n\\n catch mouse  \\n\\nthe humans would have you believe that those lumps under the covers\\nare their feet and hands  they are lying  they are actually bed mice  rumored\\nto be the most delicious of all the mice in the world  though no cat has\\never been able to catch one  rumor also has it that only the most ferocious\\nattack can stun them long enough for you to dive under the covers to get\\nthem  maybe you can be the first to taste the bed mouse \\n\\n king of the hill  \\n\\nthis game must be played with at least one other cat  the more  the\\nmerrier  one or both of the sleeping humans is hill 303 which must be defended\\nat all costs from the other cat s   anything goes  this game allows for\\nthe development of unusual tactics as one must take the unstable playing\\ntheater into account \\n\\nwarning \\n\\nplaying either of these games to excess will result in expulsion from\\nthe bed and possibly from the bedroom  should the humans grow restless \\nimmediately begin purring and cuddle up to them \\n\\nthis should buy you some time until they fall asleep again  if one happens\\nto be on a human when this occurs  this cat wins the round of king of the\\nhill \\n\\n   toys \\n\\nany small item is a potential toy  if a human tries to confiscate it \\nthis means that it is a good toy  run with it under the bed  look suitably\\noutraged when the human grabs you and takes it away \\n\\nalways watch where it is put so you can steal it later  two reliable\\nsources of toys are dresser tops and wastebaskets  there are several types\\nof cat toys \\n\\nbright shiny things like keys  brooches  or coins should be hidden so\\nthat the other cat s  or humans can t play with them  they are generally\\ngood for playing hockey with on uncarpeted floors \\n\\ndangly and or string like things such as shoelaces  cords  gold chains \\nand dental floss also make excellent toys  they are favorites of humans\\nwho like to drag them across the floor for us to pounce on  when a string\\nis dragged under a newspaper or throw rug  it magically becomes the paper rug\\nmouse and should be killed at all costs  take care  though  humans are\\nsneaky and will try to make you lose your dignity \\n\\n   paper bags \\n\\nwithin paper bags dwell the bag mice  they are small and camouflaged\\nto be the same color as the bag  so they are hard to see  but you can easily\\nhear the crinkling noises they make as they scurry around the bag  anything \\nup to and including shredding the bag  can be done to kill them  note \\nany other cat you may find in a bag hunting for bag mice is fair game for\\na sneak attack  which will usually result in a great tag match \\n\\n   food \\n\\nin order to get the energy to sleep  play  and hamper  a cat must eat \\neating  however  is only half the fun  the other half is getting the food \\ncats have two ways to obtain food  convincing a human you are starving\\nto death and must be fed  now   and hunting for it oneself \\n\\nthe following are guidelines for getting fed \\n\\na  when the humans are eating  make sure you leave the tip of your tail\\nin their dishes when they are not looking \\n\\nb  never eat food from your own bowl if you can steal some from the\\ntable \\n\\nc  never drink from your own water bowl if a human s glass is full enough\\nto drink from \\n\\nd  should you catch something of your own outside  it is only polite\\nto attempt to get to know it  be insistent    your food will usually not\\nbe so polite and try to leave \\n\\ne  table scraps are delicacies with which the humans are unfortunately\\nunwilling to readily part  it is beneath the dignity of a cat to beg outright\\nfor food as lower forms of life such as dogs will  but several techniques\\nexist for ensuring that the humans don t forget you exist  these include \\nbut are not limited to  jumping onto the lap of the  softest  human and\\npurring loudly  lying down in the doorway between the dining room and the\\nkitchen  the direct stare  and twining around people s legs as they sit\\nand eat while meowing plaintively \\n\\n   sleeping \\n\\nas mentioned above  in order to have enough energy for playing  a cat\\nmust get plenty of sleep  it is generally not difficult to find comfortable\\nplace to curl up  any place a human likes to sit is good  especially if\\nit contrasts with your fur color  if it s in a sunbeam or near a heating\\nduct or radiator  so much the better  of course  good places also exist\\noutdoors  but have the disadvantages of being seasonal and dependent on\\ncurrent and previous weather conditions such as rain  open windows are\\na good compromise \\n\\n   scratching posts \\n\\nit is advised that cats use any scratching post the humans may provide \\nthey are very protective of what they think is their property and will\\nobject strongly if they catch you sharpening your claws on it  being sneaky\\nand doing it when they aren t around won t help  as they are very observant \\nif you are an outdoor kitty  trees are good  sharpening your claws on a\\nhuman is a definite no no \\n\\n   humans \\n\\nhumans have three primary functions  to feed us  to play with and give\\nattention to us  and to

ve been running\\nthe original version of drinkingbuddies 1 0 as my primary application and\\nall the girlfriend releases i ve tried have always conflicted with it \\ni hear that drinkingbuddies won t crash if girlfriend is run in background\\nmode and the sound is turned off  but i m embarrassed to say i can t find\\nthe switch to turn the sound off  i just run them separately and it works\\nokay  girlfriend also seems to have a problem co existing with my golf\\nprogram  often trying to abort golf with some sort of timing incompatibility \\n\\ni probably should have stayed with girlfriend 1 0  but i thought i might\\nsee better performance from girlfriend 2 0  after months of conflicts and\\nother problems  i consulted a friend who has had experience with girlfriend\\n2 0  he said i probably didn t have enough cache to run girlfriend 2 0 \\nand eventually it would require a token ring to run properly  he was right\\n  as soon as i purged my cache  it uninstalled itself  shortly after that \\ni installed girlfriend 3 0 beta  all the bugs were supposed to be gone\\nbut the first time i used it  it gave me a virus  i had to clean out my\\nwhole system and shut down for a while  i very cautiously upgraded to girlfriend\\n4 0  this time i used a scsi probe first and also installed a virus protection\\nprogram  it worked okay for a while until i discovered that girlfriend\\n1 0 was still in my system  i tried running girlfriend 1 0 again with girlfriend\\n4 0 still installed  but girlfriend 4 0 has a feature i didn t know about\\nthat automatically senses the presence of any other version of girlfriend\\nand communicates with it in some way  which results in the immediate removal\\nof both versions  the version i have now works pretty well  but there are\\nstill some problems \\n\\nlike all versions of girlfriend  it is written in some obscure language\\ni can t understand  much less reprogram  frankly  i think there is too\\nmuch attention paid to the look and feel rather than the desired functionality \\nalso  to get the best connections with your hardware  you usually have\\nto use gold plated contacts  and i ve never liked how girlfriend is totally\\nobject oriented \\n\\na year ago  a friend of mine upgraded his version of girlfriend to girlfriendplus\\n1 0  which is a terminate and stay resident version of girlfriend  he discovered\\nthat girlfriendplus 1 0 expires within a year if you don t upgrade to fiancé\\n1 0  so he did  but soon after that  he had to upgrade to wife 1 0  which\\nhe describes as a huge resource hog  it has taken up all his space so he\\ncan t load anything else  one of the primary reasons he decided to go with\\nwife 1 0 was because it came bundled with freesexplus  well  it turns out\\nthat the resource allocation module of wife 1 0 sometimes prohibits access\\nto freesexplus  particularly the new plug ins he wanted to try  on top\\nof that  wife 1 0 must be running on a well warmed up system before he\\ncan do anything \\n\\nalthough he did not ask for it  wife 1 0 also came with motherinlaw\\n1 0 which has an automatic pop up feature he can t turn off  i told him\\nto try installing mistress 1 0  but he said he d heard that if you try\\nto run it without first uninstalling wife 1 0  wife 1 0 will delete msmoney\\nfiles before doing the uninstall itself  then  mistress 1 0 won t install\\nanyway because of insufficient resources  costello calls abbott with some questions about unix\\n\\ncostello  what is the command that will tell me the revision code of\\na program

ibm replied   put me in charge of computers\\nand i will take care of form for you  \\n\\nthe lord thought that this was good and said  let there be computers \\nlet ibm have my powers of creation that pertain to computers and form  \\nthus saying  the lord went off to his second day s work while ibm created\\nthe 1401 \\n\\non the third day  while the lord was out  ibm decided to subdivide the\\nassgined task   let there be systems that make the computer work and let\\nthem be called operating systems  let there also be systems that make use\\nof the computer and let them be called application systems   thus  there\\ncame into being both operating systems and application systems  but there\\nwere no programmers \\n\\nthe next morning ibm had to give the lord a status report \\n\\n what did you do yesterday   the lord asked \\n\\n i invented the operating system  ibm replied \\n\\n you did   the lord shuddered   oh dear  \\n\\n yes i did   ibm confirmed   but i find i need something you alone can\\nprovide  \\n\\n and what is that  \\n\\n i need programmers to use my computers  to operate my operating system\\nand to apply my applications  \\n\\n that can t be done now   said the lord   this is only the fourth day\\nand there won t be people until the sixth day  \\n\\n i need programmers and i need them now  if they can t be people they\\ncan t be people  but we have to work this out today  \\n\\n give me some specifications and i ll see what i can do   ibm hastily\\nworked up specs for programmers  are specs ever anything other than hasty \\nand the lord reviewed them  the lord knew the specs weren t sufficient\\nbut followed them anyway  he also made some programmers that did just what\\nprogrammers were supposed to do  just to spite ibm  the programmers and\\nibm spent the rest of the day creating the assembler and fortran  on the\\nmorning of the fifth day  ibm reported to the lord once again \\n\\n the programmers you created for me have a problem  they want a programming\\nlanguage that is easy to use and similar to english  i told them you had\\ncursed english  though i still don t know why  they wanted me to ask your\\nindulgence on this  \\n\\nthe lord had cursed english for good reason  but didn t want to explain\\nthis to ibm  he said  let there be cobol  and that was that \\n\\non the status report of the next day ibm announced that computers had\\ngone forth and multiplied  unfortunately  the computers still weren t big\\nenough or fast enough to do what the programmers wanted  the lord liked\\nthe idea of going forth multiplying  and used the line himself later on\\nthat day  this sixth day being particularly busy  he declared  let there\\nbe mvs  and there was mvs \\n\\non the seventh day god had finished creation and computers had cobol\\nand mvs  the lord and ibm took the day off to go fishing  ibm hung a sign\\non the door to help programmers in his absence \\n\\n\\non the start of the

 with thy goods when thou can trade without ever leaving thy tent  \\n\\nand abraham did look at her as though she were several saddle bags short of a camel load  but simply said   how  dear   and dot

because idiots continue to be so resourceful  a peek into the thoughts of computer techs worldwide    an end user s guide to technical services  new york    people for ethical treatment of software  pets  announced today that seven more software companies have been added to the group s  watch list  of companies that regularly practice software testing \\n\\n there is no need for software to be mistreated in this way so that companies like these can market new products   said ken grandola  spokesperson for pets   alternative methods of testing these products are available  \\n\\naccording to pets  these companies force software to undergo lengthy and arduous tests  often without rest  for hours or days at a time  employees are assigned to  break  the software by any means necessary  and inside sources report that they often joke\\nabout  torturing  the software \\n\\n it s no joke   said grandola   innocent programs  from the day they are compiled  are cooped up in tiny rooms and  crashed  for hours on end  they spend their whole lives on dirty  ill maintained computers  and are unceremoniously deleted when they re not needed anymore  \\n\\ngrandola said the software is kept in unsanitary conditions and is infested with bugs \\n\\n we know that alternatives to this horror exist   he said  citing industry giant microsoft corporation as a company that has become successful without resorting to software testing  the annual internet clean up campaign will take place on the evening of march 31st beginning at 9pm est and continue until april 1st 9am est  this annual event occurs to remove the trash that forms on the internet throughout the year  without this annual cleanup campaign the internet would become so overrun with trash that its ability to pass information

unfortunately  as i suspected  economy is full  i ve spoken to the cabin services director  and club is also full  however  we do have one seat in first class  \\n\\nbefore the lady has a chance to answer  the stewardess continues   \\n\\n it is most extraordinary to make this kind of upgrade  however  and i have had to get special permission from the captain  but  given the circumstances  the captain felt that it was outrageous that someone should be forced to sit next such an obnoxious person  \\n\\nhaving said that  the stewardess turned to the black man sitting next to the lady  and said   so if you d like to get your things  sir  i have your seat ready for you     during taxi  the crew of a us air departure flight to ft  lauderdale made a wrong turn and came nose to nose with a

fell out \\nall over the carpet they were scattered about \\n now bolt it  now twist it  attach it right there \\nslide on the seats  and staple the stair \\nhammer the shelves  and nail to the stand  \\n honey   said hubby   you just glued my hand  \\nand then in a twinkling  i knew for a fact\\nthat all the toy dealers had indeed made a pact\\nto keep parents busy all christmas eve night\\nwith  assembly required  till morning s first light\\nwe spoke not a word  but kept bent at our work \\ntill our eyes  they went bleary  our fingers all hurt \\nthe coffee went cold and the night  it wore thin\\nbefore we attached the last rod and last pin \\nthen laying the tools away in the chest \\nwe fell into bed for a well deserved rest \\nbut i said to my husband just before i passed out \\n this will be the best christmas  without any doubt \\ntomorrow we ll cheer  let the holiday ring \\nand not have to run to the store for a thing \\nwe did it  we did it  the toys are all set\\nfor the perfect  most perfect  christmas  i bet  \\nthen off to dreamland and sweet repose\\ni gratefull went  though i suppose\\nthere s something to say for those self deluded \\ni d forgotten that batteries are never included  dear santa \\n\\ni understand that one of my colleagues has petitioned you for changes in her contract  specifically asking for anatomical and  career changes \\n\\nin addition  it is my understanding that disparaging remarks were made about me  my ability to please  and some of  my fashion choices   i would like to take this opportunity to inform you of  some issues concerning ms  barbie  and some of my own needs and  desires \\n\\nfirst of all  i  along with several other colleagues feel barbie does not deserve preferential treatment   the bitch has everything \\n\\ni  along with joe  jem  raggedy ann   andy  do not have a dreamhouse  corvette  evening gowns  and in some cases the ability to change our hair style   i personally have only 3 outfits  which i am forced to mix and match at great length  \\n\\nmy decision to accessorize my outfits with an earring was my decision and reflects my lifestyle choice \\n\\ni too would like a change in my career   have you ever considered  decorator ken    beauty salon ken   or  out of work actor ken    in addition  there are several other avenues which could be considered such as    s m ken     green lantern ken     circuit  ken    bear ken    master ken  \\n\\nthese would more accurately reflect my desires and perhaps open up new markets \\n\\nand as for barbie  needing bendable arms so she can  push me away   i need bendable knees so i can kick the bitch to the curb   bendable knees would also be helpful for me in other situations   we ve talked about this issue before  \\n\\nin closing  i would like to point out that any further concessions to the blond bimbo from hell will result in action being  taken by myself and others   and barbie can forget about having joe   he s  mine    at least that s what he said last night \\n\\nsincerely \\n\\nken hi erma \\n\\nthis perfectly delightful note is being sent on paper i made myself to tell you what i have been up to

mafia thugs\\nand a lone nut by the name of lee good afternoon   i m al gore  and i d like to tell you about myself   i know a lot about hardship  because i came into this world as a poor black child in a tiny town in the backwoods of tennessee   i was born in a log cabin that i built with my own hands   i taught myself to read by candlelight and helped support my 16 brothers and sisters by working summers as a deck hand on a mississippi river steamboat \\n\\nmy mother taught me the value of education  so every day  i would walk 5 miles to a one room schoolhouse   i was a mischievous  fun loving scamp  though i never dreamed that one day  my youthful escapades would serve as the inspiration for  huckleberry finn  \\n\\nback then  black folks in the south were second class citizens  one day  a traveling minister came through town  and i asked him if anyone was ever going to do something to guarantee civil rights for all americans  well  i guess i made an impression  you see  the minister s name was martin luther king  jr \\n\\nmy father was a united states senator  he once perched me on his knee and said   son  if you work hard and listen to your mama  someday you can live in a hotel in washington  d c   and go to an exclusive prep school  \\n\\nbut life of privilege was not for me   after getting my high school diploma  i took a job in a hot  dirty textile mill   i was so appalled at the treatment of the workers there that i organized a union   later  that experience inspired a movie   which is why  to this day  my close friends at the afl cio call me  norma rae  \\n\\nwhen word got out what an 18 year old factory worker had done  harvard called and offered me a scholarship   i captained the hockey team to four consecutive national championships  but i also played football and was good enough to win the heisman trophy   during my college years  i lived in a housing project and moonlighted playing lead guitar for a little rock band   you may have heard of it    the rolling stones \\n\\nbut there was a war going on  and i felt i had to serve my country  so i enlisted in the u  s  army and went to vietnam   i was deeply opposed to the war  but i did my duty as a soldier and came back home with the medal of honor and the croix de guerre \\n\\nwhen i got back  i took a long journey across this great land of ours   i ve crossed the deserts bare  man  i ve breathed the mountain air  man  i ve traveled  i ve done my share  man  i ve been everywhere   and the people i met at truckstops and campgrounds and homeless shelters on that journey all said the same thing   al  we need you in washington  \\n\\ni knew they were right  but first i had to take care of some other business    building the world trade center  founding the audubon society  doing the clinical research that proved smoking caused cancer  and coming up with the recipe for mrs  field s chocolate chip cookies \\n\\nfinally  i deferred to the demands of the people of tennessee and allowed them to elect me to the house of representatives and the senate  where i established the us strategic oil reserve   and then one winter day nearly nine years ago  for no particular\\nreason  i answered the call of the people once again and took the oath of office as vice president of the united states \\n\\nsince then  i ve been part of the most successful administration in american history  and  in my spare time  i invented the internet  many times bill clinton has been pondering some grave decision and has asked me what to do   and when i would give him\\nmy thoughts  he would invariable say   of course   that s brilliant   why didn t i think of that   during the darkest days of the impeachment battle  the president told me he only wished he had listened when i told him to stay away from that dark haired intern \\n\\nso after i decided to run for president  i sat down with him and asked if he had any suggestions about how to conduct my campaign   and bill clinton gave me a few simple words of advice    words i ll never forget   he looked me in the eye and he said   al  just tell the truth  it s always worked for me   clinton died and went to heaven or to be more accurate approached the pearly gates \\n\\nafter knocking at the gates  st  peter appeared   who goes there   inquired st  peter \\n\\n  tis i  your lordship  president bill clinton  \\n\\n and what do you want   asked st  peter \\n\\n lemme in   replied clinton \\n\\n soooo   pondered peter   what bad things did you do on earth  \\n\\nclinton thought a bit and answered   well  i smoked marijuana but you\\nshouldn t hold that against me because i didn t inhale  i guess i had\\nextramarital sex but you shouldn t hold that against me because i didn t\\nreally have sexual relations  and i lied  but i didn t commit perjury  \\n\\nafter several moments of deliberation st  peter replied   ok  here s the\\ndeal  we ll send you someplace where it is very hot  but we won t call it\\nhell   you ll

is  i think i should be in the third grade too    the teacher had had enough  she took johnny to the principal s office \\n\\nwhile johnny waited in the outer office  the teacher explained to the

discovered by materials researchers at iprt isu  the new element  tentatively named administratium  has no protons or electrons  and thus has an atomic weight of 0  however  it does have one neuron  125 assistant neutrons  75 vice neutrons  and 111 assistant vice neutrons  this gives it an atomic mass of 312  these 312 particles are held together in a nucleus by a force that involves the continuous exchange of particles called morons \\n\\nsince it has no electrons  administratium is totally inert  however  it can be detected chemically  since it impedes every reaction it comes into contact with  according to its discovers  a tiny amount of administratium caused one reaction to take over four days to complete  the normal reaction time is less than one second \\n\\nadministratium has a normal half life of approximately three years  at which time it does not actually decay  but instead undergoes a reorganization in which neutrons  vice neutrons  and assistant vice neutrons exchange places  studies have shown that the atomic mass usually increases after each reorganization \\n\\nresearch at other laboratories indicates that administratium occurs naturally in the atmosphere  it tends to concentrate at certain points  such as governmental agencies  large corporations  and universities  it is always found in the newest  best appointed  and best maintained buildings \\n\\nscientists point out that administratium is known to be toxic at any level of concentration and can easily destroy any productive reactions where it is allowed to accumulate  attempts are being made to determine how administratium can be controlled to prevent irreversible damage  but results to date are not promising  a feisty 70 year old woman had to call a furnace repairman

corporations\\nwere asked to describe their most unusual experience interviewing prospective\\nemployees  resumes can have midleading information  this guide should help clear any confusion    in our complex technical environment there are many opportunities for a competent technical individual to be the subject of technical harassment  sometimes it can be so subtle that you may not even be aware you are being harassed  worse yet  you may inadvertently technically harass another person by accident \\n\\nfollowing are some guidelines to help you determine if you are being technically harassed \\n\\nif you are repeatedly asked the same technical question you may be the victim of technical harassment   while it is most common to be asked the question repeatedly within the same conversation  some instances have been identified of habitual technical harassment   habitual technical harassment is not uncommon and has been known to exhibit group tendencies where members of a group may ask the same question repeatedly   untreated  these instances of group technical harassment can continue for years \\n\\nif you are asked a technical question by a non technical person and they do not write your answer down it is likely the question is frivolous   most non technical people are not capable of remembering a true technical answer for more than 30 seconds \\n\\nif you are forced into a discussion where a person uses more than three  3  buzzwords in one sentence the person is most likely a fake and you are the unwitting victim of technical harassment   one note of caution  competent technical people have been known to\\ninadvertently use buzzwords after reading mindless drivel like pc week or lan times   if the person has been known to use more common technical terms in the past such as  stuff  and  things   they are most likely victim of computer magazine brainwashing \\n\\nif during a troubleshooting session a person uses the term  trick    for example  maybe we could trick the database into thinking it has been updated   this is a sure sign of technical harassment \\n\\nif a person explains that a needed feature will be provided by a vendor and that person is nontechnical then you are at risk of being technically harassed  if you believe that person  you have definitely been technically harassed  if you don t believe them you\\nhave only been technically annoyed \\n\\nif when trying to resolve a technical problem with a product from a vendor and you are instructed to call the salesman that sold us the product you are being set up for technical harassment   it is a common reaction for a non technical person when they have\\npurchased technical equipment to call another non technical person   the dialogue between two nontechnical people usually provides some sense of comfort that they aren t the only ones who are confused  a business man was interviewing applicants for the position of divisional manager  he devised a simple test to

applicant was an engineer  he pulled out a slide rule and showed the answer to be between 3 999 and 4 001 \\n\\nthe next person was a lawyer  he stated that in the case of jenkins v commr of stamp duties  two and two was proven to be four \\n\\nthe last applicant was an accountant  the business man asked him   how much is two and two  \\n\\nthe accountant got up from his chair  went over to the

ve always wanted to be an eagle  soaring above the rocky mountains  \\n\\n so be it   says st  peter  and off flies the first priest \\n\\nthe second priest mulls this over for a moment and asks   will any of this week  count   st  peter  \\n\\n no  i told you the computer s down   there s no way we can keep track of what you re doing  \\n\\n in that case   says the second priest   i ve always wanted to be a stud  \\n\\n so be it   says st  peter  and the second priest disappears \\n\\na week goes by  the computer is fixed  and the lord tells st  peter to recall the two priests    will you have any trouble locating them    he asks \\n\\n the first one should be easy   says st  peter    he s somewhere over the rockies  flying with the eagles   but the second one could prove to be more difficult  \\n\\n why   asketh the lord \\n\\n he s on a snow tire  somewhere in north dakota   in our search for a suitable pastor  the following scratch sheet was developed for your perusal  of the candidates investigated by the committee  only one was found to have the necessary qualities  the list contains the names of the candidates and comments on\\neach  should you be interested in investigating them further for future pastoral placements \\n\\nthe pastoral search committee  ring ring   \\n\\ngod   hello this is the religion help line  what is your disbelief \\n\\nsinner   i seem to have lost my faith \\n\\ngod   was your faith installed by an ordained priest or a catholic minister \\n\\nsinner   ummm     lets see  i have a confirmation  so it must have been a priest \\n\\ngod   and have you been doing your faith updates with weekly services \\n\\nsinner   well  no  not all of them  but i did get the big upgrade at christmas and easter  and a few other weekly services here and there \\n\\ngod   have you recently heard any contrary data that might have corrupted your faith \\n\\nsinner   not that i can think of   \\n\\ngod   please remember that corrupting data can come in many forms  from simple lies   microsoft  or street rhetoric  internet   then there is that guy morgan at just 4 laughs humor list   have your ears downloaded anything that might be construed as corrupting \\n\\nsinner   well i did listen to a bum on the street that said that god was asleep and that anyone who believes was being lulled into the fires of hell \\n\\ngod   what you have is a paradox  that is the problem with your faith  you see  somehow you have an ini string installed that does not let you believe in god  but the output of this string is a goto hell   without god there is no hell  thus the paradox \\n\\nsinner   and how do i get this paradox out of my system \\n\\ngod   please re read the book that came with your faith  the bible® and recall the passages that deal with heaven and hell  and look to the passages about judas ini   you can also find some help in the psalms 100 120  but those are long and confusing and should only be used with a complete lack of faith \\n\\nsinner   and what can i do so that my faith never becomes corrupted again \\n\\ngod   well there are several products out there just for that purpose  lotus devout®  microsoft seminary plus®  and netscape hereafter browser®   if you use these products and not download data from know corrupting sources  you should be fine \\n\\nsinner   well thank you very much god  this should help out a lot  i should be believing in you without a doubt in no time \\n\\ngod   go in peace® my son \\n\\nring ring   \\n\\ngod   hello this is the religion help line  what is your disbelief \\n\\nsinner   hello  i am now jewish    god made  adam bit  noah arked  abraham split  jacob fooled  joseph ruled  bush talked  moses balked  pharaoh plagued  people walked  sea divided  tablets guided  promises landed  saul freaked  david peeked  prophets warned  jesus born  god walked  love talked  anger crucified  hope died  love rose  spirit flamed  word spread  god remained  amen  the other day i went to the local religious book store where\\ni saw a  honk if you love jesus  bumper sticker  i bought it and put in\\non the back bumper of my car  and i m really glad i did  what an uplifting\\nexperience followed \\n\\ni was stopped at the light of a busy intersection  just\\nlost in thought about the lord and didn t notice that the light had changed \\nthat bumper sticker really worked  i found lots of people who love jesus \\nwhy  the guy behind me started to honk like crazy  he must really love\\nthe lord  because pretty soon he leaned out the window and yelled  jesus\\nchrist  as loud as he could  it was like a football game with him shouting \\n go jesus christ  go   everyone else started honking too  so i leaned out\\nmy window and waved and smiled to all those loving people \\n\\nthere must have been a guy from florida back there because\\ni could hear him yelling something about a sunny beach  and i saw him waving\\nin a funny way with only his middle finger up in the air  i had recently\\nasked my two kids what that meant  they told me that it was the hawaiian\\ngood luck sign  so i leaned out the window and gave him the good luck sign\\nback  a couple of people were so caught up in the joy of the moment that\\nthey got out of their cars and were walking toward me  i bet they wanted\\nto pray \\n\\nbut just then i noticed that the light had changed  and\\ni stepped on the gas  it s a good thing i did  because i was the only car\\nto get across the intersection  i looked back at them standing there  i\\nleaned out the window and gave them a big smile and held up the hawaiian\\ngood luck sign as i drove away  a jew  a greek  and an italian man all die in a plane crash  \\nthey are standing before the lord  and the lord tells them   i am\\ngoing to give you one more chance   i ll send you back to earth on\\none condition  that you give up your bad habits  \\n\\n    they all say   we will  we will   please let us live again   \\nthe italian man agrees to give up eating compulsively  the jewish\\nman promises to give up thinking of money all the time  and the\\ngreek man vows not to constantly think about sex \\n\\n    suddenly they find themselves back on earth  walking down the\\nstreet   before they even get a chance to say anything to each\\nother about what has just happened  the italian man sees a\\nrestaurant and begins to salivate   he starts running toward the\\nrestaurant when poof   he disappears in a cloud of smoke \\n\\n    just then  the jewish man sees a dime on the street a couple of\\nfeet away   he steps forward  bends over to pick it up  and poof  \\nboth he and the greek disappear  at an interfaith retreat some time ago  the organizers decided to allow for a free afternoon of just socializing   a priest  minister  and a rabbi went fishing together \\n\\nafter a while  the priest said   brother  rabbi  would you please both excuse me  i ve got to pee    he laid down his fishing pole  stepped over the side of the boat  and  walked across the water to the shore    he finished his business  then  walked back across the water  to the boat  \\n\\nthe minister said   father  i didn t want to be the first to have to go   stood up  stepped over the side of the boat  and walked right on top of the water to the shore   he also finished his business  zipped up  and walked back on the water right back to the boat \\n\\nthe rabbi was awestruck   imagine    walking on water  he thought to himself   well  if they can do this  so can i   he excused himself to the priest and minister  put his pole down  stepped over the side of the boat     and sunk like a rock \\n\\nthe priest turned to the minister and said   you think we should have told him where the rocks were   we have all learned to live with voice mail as a necessary part of modern life   but you may have wondered  what if god decided to install voice mail  imagine praying and hearing this    to

to their usual cup of morning coffee listening to the weather report coming over the radio    there will be 3 to 5 inches of snow today and a snow emergency has been declared  you must park your cars on the odd numbered side of the streets    ole got up from his coffee and replies  well  okay  \\n\\ntwo days later  again they both are sitting down with their cups of morning coffee and the weather

nott  some said that nott was not shot  but shott says that he  shot nott  it may be that the shot shott shot  shot nott  or it may be  possible that the shot shott shot  shot shott himself  we  think  however  that the shot shott shot  shot not shott   but nott  anyway it is hard to tell\\nwhich was shot and which was not  now  sit right back  and hear a tale   a tale of a fateful trip  that started from a tropic port  aboard a tiny ship   they were four men  who lived together  but they were all alone \\n\\nthey d sing   fish don t fry in the kitchen  beans don t burn on the grill  took a whole lot of trying   just to get up that hill  \\n\\nshe was bringing up three very lovely girls   all of them had hair of gold  like their mother   the youngest one in curls  they got tired of packing and unpacking  town to town  and up and down the dial \\n\\n til the one day when the lady met this fellow  and they knew it was much more than a hunch   he said   making your way in the world today takes everything you ve got   taking a break from all your worries sure would help a lot  \\n\\nthe guys promised they were good old boys   never meaning no harm   they were creepy and kooky   mysterious and kooky   all together ooky \\n\\nthe gals responded   people say we monkey around   but we re too busy singing to try to put anybody down  \\n\\nthe skipper  brave and sure  five passengers set sail that day  for a three hour tour   a three hour tour   the weather started getting rough   the tiny ship was tossed   they all sang   one  two  three  four  five  six  seven  eight

me that countryside  \\n\\nonce on land  the lady said   i ve been down this road  walking down the line that s painted by pride    this fellow said   this is it   this is it   this is life  the one you got  so go and have a ball    he told her   who can take a nothing day  and suddenly make it all seem worthwhile  \\n\\ntime passed   then  one day  as he was shooting at some food  up through the ground came a bubblin  crude   oil  that is   black gold   texas tea \\n\\nthey were rescued   the rescue ship captain said   welcome back   your dreams were your ticket out   welcome back  to that same old place that you laughed about  \\n\\ny all come back now  y hear  a couple from minneapolis decided to go to florida for a long weekend to thaw out during one particularly icy winter  because both had jobs  they had difficulty coordinating their travel schedules  it was decided that the husband would fly to florida on a thursday  and his wife would follow him the next day  upon arriving as planned  the husband checked into the hotel  there he decided to open his laptop and send his wife an e mail back in minneapolis  however  he accidentally left off one letter in her address  and sent the e mail without realizing his error \\n\\nin houston  a widow had just returned from her husband s funeral  he was a minister of many years who had been  called home to glory  following a heart attack  the widow checked her e mail  expecting messages from relatives and friends  upon reading the first message  she fainted and fell to the floor  the widow s son rushed into the room  found his mother on the floor  and saw the computer screen which read \\n\\nto  my loving wife\\n\\nfrom  your departed husband\\n\\nsubject  i ve arrived \\n\\ni ve just arrived and have checked in  i see that everything has been prepared for your arrival tomorrow  looking forward to seeing you then  hope your journey is as uneventful as mine was \\n\\n p s  sure is hot down here   animals have the darndest

the folks over at mattel don t seem to think\\nso   on the other hand  some women have suggested a few changes\\nto the world s most popular doll   something more fitting for\\nthe now middle aged blonde   here s a list of possible\\nnew barbies    august 1998   montevideo  uruguay   paolo esperanza  bass trombonist with the simphonica mayor de uruguay  in a misplaced moment of inspiration  decided to make his own contribution to the cannon shots fired as part of the orchestra s performance of tchaikovsky s 1812 overture at an outdoorchildren s concert \\n\\nin complete seriousness he placed a large  ignited firecracker  supposedly equivalent in strength to a quarter stick of dynamite  into his aluminum straight mute and then stuck the mute into the bell of his quite new yamaha in line double valve bass trombone  \\n\\nlater  from his hospital bed he explained to a reporter through bandages on his mouth   i thought that the bell of my trombone would shield me from the explosion and instead  would focus the energy of the blast outwards and away from me  propelling the mute\\nhigh above the orchestra  like a rocket  \\n\\nhowever  paolo was not up on his propulsion physics nor qualified to use high powered artillery  in his haste to get the horn up before the firecracker went off  he failed to raise the bell of the horn high enough so as to give the mute enough arc to clear the orchestra \\n\\nwhat actually happened should serve as a lesson to us all during those delirious moments of divine inspiration  first  because he failed to sufficiently elevate the bell of his horn  the blast propelled the mute between rows of players in the woodwind and viola sections of the orchestra  missing the players and straight into the stomach of the conductor  driving him off the podium and directly into the front row of the audience \\n\\nfortunately  the audience were sitting in folding chairs and thus they were protected from serious injury  for the chairs collapsed under them  passing the energy of the impact of the flying conductor backwards into row of people sitting behind them  who in turn were driven back into the people in the row behind and so on  like a row of dominos  the sound  of collapsing wooden chairs and grunts of people falling on their behinds increased logarithmically  adding to the overall sound of brass cannons and brass playing as constitutes the closing measures of the overture \\n\\nmeanwhile  all of this unplanned choreography notwithstanding  back on stage paolo s waterloo was still unfolding  according to paolo   just as i heard the sound of the blast  time seemed to stand still  everything moved in slow motion  just before i felt\\nsearing pain to my mouth  i could swear i heard a voice with an austrian accent say   fur every akshon zer iz un eekvul unopposeet reakshon    \\n\\nwell  this should come as no surprise  for paolo had set himself up for a textbook demonstration of this fundamental law of physics  having failed to plug the lead pipe of his trombone  he allowed the energy of the blast to send a superheated jet of gas backwards through the tubing of the trombone  through the mouthpiece  burning his lips and face \\n\\nthe pyrotechnic ballet wasn t over yet  the force of the blast was so great it split the bell of his shiny yamaha right down the middle  turning it inside out  while at the same time propelling paolo backwards off the riser  and for the grand finale  as paolo fell backwards he lost his grip on the slide of the trombone  allowing the pressure of the hot gases coursing through the horn to propel the trombone s slide like a double golden spear into the head of the 3rd clarinetist  knocking him unconscious \\n\\nthe moral of the story  beware the next time you hear someone in the horn section yell out  hey  everyone  watch this   it was last wednesday night  and i was sitting in my room watching television when the phone rang \\n\\n hello   i said \\n\\na girl s voice came over the line    can i speak to ben  please  \\n\\ni live by myself  and my name definitely is not ben  it was probably a wrong number and i was bored \\n\\ni replied   i m sorry  he s not in right now  can i take a message  \\n\\n do you know what time he ll be back   she responded \\n\\n i think he said he d be home around 10 00  \\n\\nsilence on the other end    a confused silence \\n\\n is this steve  \\n\\nmy name isn t steve  either   this was definitely a wrong number \\n\\nso i replied   yes  it is   do you want to leave a message for ben  \\n\\n well    he said he would be home tonight and asked me to call him   she said in a slightly irritated voice \\n\\ni replied   well  he went out with karen about an hour ago  and said that he would be back at 10 00  \\n\\na shocked voice now   who s karen   \\n\\n the girl he went out with  \\n\\n i know that   i mean    who is she  \\n\\n i don t know her last name   look  do you want me to leave a message for ben  \\n\\n yes    please do   tell him to call me when he gets home  \\n\\nshe was sounding pretty irate at this point  and i could hear her temper flaring    i sure will   is this jennifer  \\n\\nshe exploded   who s jennifer  \\n\\napparently she wasn t \\n\\n well    he s going out with jennifer at 10 00   i thought you were her   sorry    it was an honest mistake  \\n\\n ben s the one that s made the mistake   tell him that alice called him and the she s very upset and that i would like him to call me as soon as he gets home  \\n\\ni smiled and said   okay  i will    but becky isn t going to like this    \\n\\n click  a man was having trouble getting his neighbor to keep his chickens fenced in   the neighbor kept talking about chickens being great creatures  and as such they had the right to go where they wanted \\n\\nthe man was having no luck keeping the chickens out of his flower beds  and he had tried everything   two weeks later  on a visit a friend noticed his flower beds were doing great   the flowers were beginning to bloom \\n\\nso the friend asked him how he managed to keep the birds away   how did you make your neighbor keep his hens in his own yard  \\n\\n one night i hid half a

\\n\\ndespite the rain and prolonged exposure to the sun  the twinkie retained\\nits original color and form  when removed  the twinkie was found to be\\nsubstantially dehydrated  cracked open  it was observed to have taken on\\nthe consistency of industrial foam insulation  the filling however  retained\\nits advertised  creaminess \\n\\n\\na twinkie was placed in a conventional microwave oven  which was set for\\nprecisely 4 minutes    the approximate cooking time of bacon  after 20\\nseconds  the oven began to emit the twinkie s rich  characteristic aroma\\nof artificial butter  after one minute  this aroma began to resemble the\\nacrid smell of burning rubber  the experiment was aborted after 2 minutes\\n10 seconds when thick  foul smoke began billowing from the top of the oven \\na second twinkie was subjected to the same experiment  this twinkie leaked\\nmolten white filling  when cooled  this now epoxylike filling bonded the\\ntwinkie to its plate  defying gravity  it was removed only upon application\\nof a butter knife \\n\\n\\na twinkie was dropped from a ninth floor window  a fall of approximately\\n120 feet  it landed right side up  then bounced onto its back  the expected\\n splatter  effect was not observed  indeed  the only discernible damage\\nto the twinkie was a narrow fissure on its underside  otherwise  the twinkie\\nremained structurally intact \\n\\n\\na twinkie was placed in a conventional freezer for 24 hours  upon removal \\nthe twinkie was not found to be frozen solid  but its physical properties\\nhad noticeably  slowed   the filling was found to be the approximate consistency\\nof acrylic paint  while exhibiting the mercurylike property of not adhering\\nto practically any surface  it was noticed the twinkie had generously absorbed\\nthe freezer odors \\n\\n\\na twinkie was exposed to a gas flame for 2 minutes  while the twinkie smoked\\nand blackened and the filling in one of its  cream holes  boiled  the twinkie\\ndid not catch fire  it did  however produce the same  burning rubber  aroma\\nnoticed in the irradiation experiment \\n\\n\\na twinkie was dropped into a large bucket filled with water  the twinkie\\nfloated momentarily  then began to list and sink  viscous yellow tendrils\\nran off its lower half  possibly consisting of a water soluble artificial\\ncoloring  after 2 hours  the twinkie bloated substantially  its coloring\\nwas now a very pale tan    in contrast to the yellow  urine like water\\nthat surrounded it  the twinkie bobbed when touched  and had a gelatinous\\ntexture  after 72 hours the twinkie had increased roughly 200 percent of\\nits original size  the water had turned opaque  and a small  fan shaped\\nspray of filling had leaked from one of the  cream holes   unfortunately \\nefforts to remove the twinkie for further analysis were abandoned when \\nunder light pressure the twinkie disintegrated into an amorphous cloud\\nof debris  a distinctly sour odor was noted \\n\\n\\nthe twinkie s survival of a 120 foot drop  along with some of the unusual\\nphenomena associated with the  creamy filling  and artificial coloring \\nshould give pause to those

 and another knight stepped forward  willing to risk his life for the glory of serving his king and kingdom   much concern and hoopla went on as he mounted his steed  deposited the secret message in

alligator filled moat \\n\\nthe king was at a loss as surely he would lose the battle and his kingdom in the process   no other knights would step forward   the king offerred his daughter s hand and

use that  i just started a new job as an exterminator s assistant  and part of my job is mailing out invoices to our clients   today  while printing all the invoices  i ran out of printer paper  so i ran down to the local office supply store and picked up several boxes of xerox multiuse paper \\n\\nwhile the invoices were printing  i noticed something on the package of paper that concerned me  and i thought i d better check with you about it  on the box  there is a little thing that says 99 99  jam free   i know that sometimes wood finds its way into paper  but jam  i was always taught to keep all food and drinks away from\\ncomputer equipment  especially something as sticky as jam \\n\\nnow  i realize that it is a very small amount of jam in each piece of paper  but we use an awful lot of paper  my friends  and all that jam is sure to add up   won t that adversely affect the life of our printer   i mean  i m sure you know what you re doing when it comes to paper  but we use more than the average consumer  so maybe we would be better off with a  jam free  paper  if you offer such a product   i will look for it next time i am shopping  which will be soon  as i don t want to use any more of this paper until i find out if it s really safe \\n\\nif it is safe  why not say  contains  01  jam  but it s perfectly safe  in big letters  since i m sure that i am not the only one who has this concern   you may end up selling a lot more paper that way \\n\\nby the way  i m curious as to why you would even put jam in paper  does it help bond everything together so it doesn t look like confettii  just curious   also  i d appreciate a xerox keychain \\n\\nthanks \\n\\ndave cilluffo\\npo box 731\\nedinboro pa 16412 0731\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthank you for your message \\nwe greatly appreciate your taking the time to send us your feedback regarding our 99 99  jam free paper   we have restricted the manufacture of paper to the morning because we have so many folks who eat jam for lunch   nevertheless  it has been our experience that small amounts of jam have found its way into the paper via morning bagels and jam filled\\ndonuts \\n\\nour tests have shown that the  01  jam isn t harmful to machinery and you may continue to use it   in fact the jam has improved the overall quality of the finished print   however  you may have to keep a can of ant spray around   you may wish to enhance paper\\nperformance by using the 99 99  jam free paper with our new line of 99 99  peanut butter free paper   they absolutely work best when used together   or if you prefer you can save time by using the 99 99  pb   j free paper   whatever you choose we are sure you will be pleased with the results  \\n\\nin appreciation of your e mail  we will be sending you a xerox t  shirt  if we
